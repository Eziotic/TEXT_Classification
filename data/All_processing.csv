Ant,positive,fixme formatters are not thread safe
Ant,positive,xxx jon skeet the comment if it has not been done already may not be strictly true wrapper maybeconfigure  wo not configure the same attributes text more than once but it may well add the children again unless i have missed something
Ant,positive,i hate to admit it but we do not know what happened here throw the exception
Ant,positive,just a note starteam has a status for new which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository these are the items that show up as not in view in the starteam gui one would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the new items not in all cases steve cohen dec  unfortunately the sdk does not really work and we ca not actually see anything with a status of new that is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything
Ant,positive,the generated classes must not be added in the generic jar is that buggy on old jonas ?
Ant,positive,todo is this comment still relevant ? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
Ant,positive,this is turned off temporarily there appears to be a bug in selectorutils matchpattern  where it is recursive on windows even if no is in pattern assertequals ffftffffffff results unix vs assertequals ffftfffftfff results windows
Ant,positive,pattern now holds while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that
Ant,positive,fixme is no namespace is empty namespace really ok ?
Ant,positive,fixme this is actually not very cpu cycles friendly as we are converting from dos to java while the underlying sun implementation will convert from java to dos time for internal storage
Ant,positive,check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several times this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases
Ant,positive,todo a warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will cause some trouble the parser should definitely be much better
Ant,positive,todo is this comment still relevant ? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
Ant,positive,xxx i really do not like this the xml processor is still too involved in the processing a better solution imo would be to create ue for project and target too and then process the tree and have project target deal with its attributes similar with description if we eventually switch to or add support for dom things will work smoothly ue can be avoided almost completely it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility
Ant,positive,junit wraps solo tests this way we can extract the original test name with a little hack
Ant,positive,xxx ignore attributes in a different ns maybe store them ?
Ant,positive,borrowed from tokenfiltertest
Ant,positive,xxx move to project so it is shared by all helpers
Ant,positive,what is the property supposed to be ?
Ant,positive,pr hack for ant type value an ant type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri name
Ant,positive,there is a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
Ant,positive,stolen from org apache xerces impl xmlentitymanager getuserdir  of the xerces j team which ascii characters need to be escaped
Ant,positive,bingo append it this should normally not be done here
Ant,positive,this is faintly ridiculous
Ant,positive,cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility
Ant,positive,todo not read yet in a public setter
Ant,positive,pr i do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only
Ant,positive,not sure what could be the need of this
Ant,positive,xxx jon skeet any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here ? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure ?
Ant,positive,experimental testing will be removed
Ant,positive,xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container touri  tourl  and the same permissioncollection as project class protectiondomain had
Ant,positive,this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
Ant,positive,xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky
Ant,positive,silly hack to avoid stack overflow
Ant,positive,access to property tables this is used to support ant call and similar tasks it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better more efficient mechanism to preserve the context
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,temporary until we figure a better api
Ant,positive,there is a better way to save the context this should not delegate to next it is for backward compatibility only
Ant,positive,quick fix for ant java use of property before initializing the project
Ant,positive,xxx we should use jcvs www ice com jcvs instead of command line execution so that we do not rely on having native cvs stuff around sm
Ant,positive,two reasons are mentioned in the api docs for file list  dir is not a directory this is impossible as we would not get here in this case  an io error occurred why does not it throw an exception then ? ?
Ant,positive,jakarta commons logging listener note do not use the simplelog as your logger implementation as it causes an infinite loop since it writes to system err which ant traps and reroutes to the logger listener layer the following names are used for the log org apache tools ant project project name for project events org apache tools ant target target name for target events task class name target name for events in individual targets in all target and project names we replace and with todo we should use the advanced context logging features and expose them in c l first todo this is very inefficient switching the out and tracking the logs can be optimized a lot but may require few more changes to the core since ant
Ant,positive,todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it this should probably be modified to use the classname instead
Ant,positive,these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us
Ant,positive,this is a rather hairy case one of our subclasses knows that we need to update the archive but at the same time there are no resources known to us that would need to be added only the subclass seems to know what is going on this happens if jar detects that the manifest has changed for example the manifest is not part of any resources because of our support for inline manifest s if we invoke createemptyzip like ant  did we will loose all stuff that has been in the original archive bugzilla report
Ant,positive,this is deprecated use classespath in the future
Ant,positive,xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials gotta remove
Ant,positive,set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a target is out of date todo this is not yet used param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of date
Ant,positive,this may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities
Ant,positive,we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error warning xxx is this correct ?
Ant,positive,the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
Ant,positive,xxx what is the following doing ? should it run if javadoc executable "null" ?
Ant,positive,mac os and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
Ant,positive,todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter
Ant,positive,xxx we are committing combiningchar and extender here
Ant,positive,xxx failed to load the class properly should we print a warning here ?
Ant,positive,xxx could perhaps also call thread stop  not sure if anyone cares
Ant,positive,xxx perhaps we should not use properties for these three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic  but include it in the javac directive ?
Ant,positive,xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement other patterns ?
Ant,positive,todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc you have to provide the rules in the constructors no setters available
Ant,positive,probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in classpath
Ant,positive,fix for invalid characters if you think of more add to the list
Ant,positive,fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or do not know how to handle it there is no easy way to know what idl mode would generate this is supposed to make ant always recompile the class as a file of that name should not exist
Ant,positive,check it out also ugly
Ant,positive,i ca not get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here ?
Ant,positive,quick dirty to make nested mapped p sets work
Ant,positive,xxx is this code still necessary ? is there any  port ? pull in zip from packages directory
Ant,positive,only the developer knows what s he is doing
Ant,positive,xxx unfortunately jdk adds entryset  keyset  values  implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later
Ant,positive,first developer could use a little help
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,xxx should throw an exception instead ?
Ant,positive,xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation ?
Ant,positive,xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation ?
Ant,positive,since java  return normalizedpath split  workaround for java
Ant,positive,hammer end inline maingtu
Ant,positive,this array really should not be here again for historical purposes it is p fixme this array should be in a private or package private location since it could be modified by malicious code p
Ant,positive,should move to a separate public class and have api to add listeners etc
Ant,positive,should become a single empty argument same for pr
Ant,positive,not very nice but will do the job
Ant,positive,provide public visibility
Ant,positive,not used but public so theoretically must remain for bc ?
Ant,positive,super validateattributes  do not want to call this method
Ant,positive,xxx what is this for ?
Ant,positive,we keep this so we have something to delete in later tests
Ant,positive,copied from concattest
Ant,positive,not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions
Ant,positive,we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up do we need to do this ? lh
Ant,positive,why do we do nothing ?
Ant,positive,we have to deal with assembly  the programmer can be writing little byte chunks for all we know and we must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer ? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying
Ant,positive,this is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath the code is currently the same you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files
Ant,positive,xxx why not simply new file dir filename ?
Ant,positive,this is ugly checking for the root folder
Ant,positive,todo parameterise ? call compiler as class dont want to fork again use classic compiler can be parameterised ?
Ant,positive,xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky careful similar code in scandir but slightly different
Ant,positive,stolen from writemanifest
Ant,positive,if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this so that in case of errors we do not leave people worse off than when we started
Ant,positive,xxx is the following really necessary ? it is in the same thread group
Ant,positive,we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
Ant,positive,this is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above
Ant,positive,for script example that modifies ided tasks in other targets to work very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable
Ant,positive,do not call super close  because that reader is used on other places
Ant,positive,report error if something weird happens this is diagnostic
Ant,positive,sorry otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader
Ant,positive,hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor
Ant,positive,singleton for now it may change per classloader
Ant,positive,xxx should not this always return false in isolated mode ?
Ant,positive,to do delete the file if it is not a valid file
Ant,positive,todo comment field does not include all options yet
Ant,positive,to do delete the file if it is not a valid file
Ant,positive,this method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the code ejbfiles code and compares them to the timestamp on the code jarfile code if the code jarfile code is timestamp is more recent than each ejb file code true code is returned otherwise code false code is returned todo find a way to check the manifest file that is found by naming convention param ejbfiles hashtable of ejb classes and other files that will be added to the completed jar file param jarfile jar file which will contain all of the ejb classes and other files return boolean indicating whether or not the code jarfile code is up to date
Ant,positive,have to think about lazy initialization here jhm comparator new java text rulebasedcollator
Ant,positive,todo comment field does not include all options yet
Ant,positive,todo no methods yet for getclassname todo no method for newinstance using a reverse classloader
Ant,positive,the displayname variable stores the value of the display name element from the standard ejb descriptor as a future enhancement to this task we may determine the name of the ejb jar file using this display name but this has not be implemented yet
Ant,positive,an output stream that compresses into the bzip format without the file header chars into another stream p the compression requires large amounts of memory thus you should call the link close  close  method as soon as possible to force tt cbzipoutputstream tt to release the allocated memory p p you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn may cause a lower compression ratio you can avoid unnecessary memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger than the size of the input p p you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the following formula p pre code k  blocksize code pre p to get the memory required for decompression by link cbzipinputstream cbzipinputstream use p pre code k  blocksize code pre table width border colgroup col width col width col width colgroup tr th colspan memory usage by blocksize th tr tr th align right blocksize th th align right compression br memory usage th th align right decompression br memory usage th tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr tr td align right k td td align right k td td align right k td tr table p for decompression tt cbzipinputstream tt allocates less memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block p p instances of this class are not threadsafe p p todo update to bzip  p
Ant,positive,xxx log an error ? throw an exception ?

Ant,positive,xxx add exceptions
Ant,positive,todo this is duplicating testresult information only the time is not part of the result so we d better derive a new class from testresult and deal with it sb

Ant,positive,the property is an id is thing either a property or a path we need to make sure that the object was created with the given id we do not have an adequate way of testing the actual value of the path object though
Ant,positive,where oh where has my test case gone ?
Ant,positive,attribute names and values while the xml spec does not require preserving the order afaik  some ant tests do rely on the exact order the following code is copied from attributeimpl we could also just use sax attributes and convert to sax dom attribute nodes can also be stored in sax attributes xxx under jdk  you can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick the only exception to this order is the treatment of refid a number of datatypes check if refid is set when other attributes are set this check will not work if the build script has the other attribute before the refid attribute so now ant  the refid attribute will be processed first

Ant,negative,optional methods you can override those methods if you want to optimize or do advanced things like support a special syntax the methods do not chain you should use them when embedding ant by replacing the main helper
Ant,negative,this class depends on each class in the dependency list for each one of those add this class into their affected classes list
Ant,negative,the capturetosummary test writes to stdout and stderr good for verifying that the testlistener support does not break anything
Ant,negative,now determine which jars each class depends upon
Ant,negative,usually the initialized is set to true but here it must not because the prepend and append readers have to be instantiated on runtime newfilter setinitialized true
Ant,negative,return here
Ant,negative,also check for properly formed uris ant formerly recommended using nonsense uris such as file foo xml in xml includes you should not do that just foo xml is correct but for compatibility we special case things when the path is not absolute and fall back to the old parsing behavior
Ant,negative,write the dependency cache to the disk

Ant,negative,the simple action is to send the command line in as is
Ant,negative,the exec os check is different from os isos  which probes for a specific os instead it searches the os field for the current os name
Ant,negative,this path should contain the class files for these testcases

Ant,negative,if the archive is built for the first time and it is matched by a resource collection then it has not been found in check it has not been there but will be included now for some strange reason the old code would simply skip the entry and not fail do the same now for backwards compatibility reasons without this the whichj build fails in gump
Ant,negative,we only like simple mappers
Ant,negative,precedence manifestfile wins over inline manifest over manifests read from the filesets over the original manifest merge with "null" argument is a no op
Ant,negative,add tsa operations if declared
Ant,negative,filesets are separate from the rest for performance reasons if we use the code for union below we will always scan all filesets even if we know the target is out of date after the first test
Ant,negative,vss items
Ant,negative,on vms platform we need to create a special java options file containing the arguments and classpath for the java command the special file is supported by the v switch on the vms jvm
Ant,negative,jar source is required
Ant,negative,preserveintarget would find all files we want to keep but we need to find all that we want to delete so the meaning of all patterns and selectors must be inverted
Ant,negative,the zero index is never present in the constant pool itself so we add a "null" entry for it
Ant,negative,if the destination directory did not already exist or was empty then no previous file removal is necessary
Ant,negative,start at because element is the executable name
Ant,negative,default the viewpath to basedir if it is not specified
Ant,negative,alias is required for signing
Ant,negative,similar to a fileset but does not allow dir attribute to be set
Ant,negative,add to the list
Ant,negative,we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up
Ant,negative,fill in args
Ant,negative,windows has a k limit on total arg size so create a temporary file to store all the arguments
Ant,negative,set up a vsshistory task
Ant,negative,at this point there is one trailing space to remove if the list is not empty
Ant,negative,restore the lastmodified attribute
Ant,negative,do nothing if no resources including nested text
Ant,negative,we normally compare destination with source
Ant,negative,filesets has been protected so we need to keep that even after switching to resource collections in fact they will still get a different treatment form the other resource collections even in execute since we have some subtle special features like switching type to dir when we encounter a dirset that would be more difficult to achieve otherwise
Ant,negative,fill in args
Ant,negative,if we get here in and out have not been specified we are in batch processing mode
Ant,negative,set source and rebuild options
Ant,negative,need to reset the stream handler to restart reading of pipes go ahead and do it always w nested redirectors
Ant,negative,rebuild unless the dest file is newer than the source file
Ant,negative,since we look ahead before adding there is one last env var
Ant,negative,mark for a rebuild if the dest file is newer
Ant,negative,chunk part of previous env var unix env vars can contain embedded new lines
Ant,negative,but if no dest is specified compare source to source
Ant,negative,on openvms runtime exec  does not support the environment array so we only return the new values which then will be set in the generated dcl script inheriting the parent process environment
Ant,negative,mono  is wsdl does not deal with absolute paths
Ant,negative,if this transformoperation has drawoperation children then rotate the first child and return
Ant,negative,add in any extra files this is an error in mono but we do not warn on it as they may fix that outside the ant build cycle
Ant,negative,noop default encoding used

Ant,negative,set up a timestamp
Ant,negative,for each sourcepath entry add a directoryset with includes taken from packagenames attribute and nested package elements and excludes taken from excludepackages attribute and nested excludepackage elements
Ant,negative,we check the presence of signatures on lazy signing
Ant,negative,if it is a non source file copy it if a later date than the dest if it is a source file see if the destination class file needs to be recreated via compilation
Ant,negative,errors
Ant,negative,helper methods
Ant,negative,bail on no references
Ant,negative,in ant  chmod dir foo means change the permissions of directory foo not anything inside of it this is the case the second branch of the if statement below catches for backwards compatibility
Ant,negative,if they are different the timestamps are used
Ant,negative,for sourcepath use the sourcepath value if present otherwise default to the srcdir value
Ant,negative,demand create pathlist
Ant,negative,sql defines as a comment to eol and in oracle it may contain a hint so we cannot just remove it instead we must end it
Ant,negative,bail on no references listed
Ant,negative,create intermediary directories sometimes zip do not add them
Ant,negative,load the property files specified by propertyfile
Ant,negative,hand down
Ant,negative,just log this
Ant,negative,for historical and performance reasons we have to do things in a rather complex way  move is optimized to move directories if a fileset has been included completely therefore filesets need a special treatment this is also required to support the failonerror semantice skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collections we carry around a few protected methods that work on basedirs and arrays of names to optimize stuff all resources with the same basedir get collected in separate lists and then each list is handled in one go
Ant,negative,loop through all definitions
Ant,negative,we have started to over write dest but failed try to delete the garbage we d otherwise leave behind

Arg,positive,returns the root package return the package which is the root deprecated for  by tfmorris use link getroots to get packages model elements which are at the top level p todo we probably need a getdefaultnamespace method or something similar to replace some uses of this
Arg,positive,updates the top level modelelements for all projects in uml  each model knows it is root elements  so this could make setroots obsolete e g  applying a stereotype in uml adds a new root todo this is redundant with setroots getroots there are already too many ways this stuff is managed without adding an additional one all current model subsystem implementations know their top level elements responsibility can be moved to the model subsystem  but let is choose one way of managing this
Arg,positive,a datastructure for settings for a project p most getters return a string  since they are used by argo tee this is also the reason all these attributes are not part of a map or something p todo the header comment is currently not used this function is not completely implemented yet how do we store this in the project ? where should the user enter his header comment ? see issue  author michiel
Arg,positive,notation settings value object stores settings which control how text is rendered on diagrams p todo this needs to go on a diet it is used everywhere  so is performance sensitive the current set of settings is the union of all those found in the legacy code  but it is not clear that all of them are actually used author tom morris tfmorris gmail com

Arg,positive,todo we really want to be able replace the initial content handler which is passed to sax  but we ca not do this without cloning a whole bunch of code because it is private in the super class
Arg,positive,if no fig was created by the code above then we must go look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse by now fig  object  rectangle  diagramsettings  all of these constructors should have been deprecated at least and replaced with the new signature this is here for paranoia only until all figs have been reviewed
Arg,positive,a fignodemodelelement with no owner should match here todo this is a temporary solution due to figpool extending fignodemodelelement when in fact it should not do so

Arg,positive,the dialog that allows the user to go to any diagram in the project by doubleclicking on it p this dialog is not modal  and can stay open while the user is working on the model it is even possible to open multiple of these dialogs  although the purpose of such useraction eludes me p todo this dialog should have multiple tabs named help  diagram  classifier  statevertex  etc which would allow the user to go to other things than diagrams author mvw
Arg,positive,todo bob says tabs that listen for target changes should register themselves not expect detailspane to listen and pass on the event otherwise these tabs always rely on detailspane tabtodotarget and tabprops currently listen directly
Arg,positive,todo some parts of argouml have preliminary support for multiple details panels  but we currently only support the default south  bottom  panel
Arg,positive,todo check that this is correct
Arg,positive,flag to indicate if we are the main application or being integrated in another top level application such as eclipse  via the argoeclipse plugin  todo this is a temporary measure until projectbrowser can be refactored more appropriately tfm
Arg,positive,todo bob says tabs that listen for target changes should register themselves not expect detailspane to listen and pass on the event otherwise these tabs always rely on detailspane tabtodotarget and tabprops currently listen directly
Arg,positive,try to save the project param overwrite if true  then we overwrite without asking param file the file to save to param pmw the progressmonitor to be updated return true if successful todo separate this into a swing specific class tfm deprecated in  by bob tarling use trysavewithprogressmonitor
Arg,positive,todo work in progress here to allow multiple details panes with different contents bob tarling
Arg,positive,todo this causes a cyclic depencency with actionsaveproject
Arg,positive,todo this needs work so that users can set the font size through a gui preference window
Arg,positive,loads a project displaying a nice progressmonitor param overwrite if true  the file is going to be overwritten param file the target file todo separate this into a swing specific class tfm param exit if true exit argouml when done
Arg,positive,todo bob says we 're looking at focus change to flag the start of an interaction this is to detect when focus is gained in a prop panel field on the assumption editing of that field is about to start not a good assumption we need to see if we can get rid of this
Arg,positive,this class represents a pool of swimlanes for activity diagrams this is exists only to act as the gef style encloser other nodes in the same must be placed entirely within or outside the boundaries of this fig but cannot intersect with the boundary p todo there is no actual model element being represented here so we are inheriting a lot of behaviour from fignodemodelelement that we do not want we require to split fignodemodelelement to separate the code that requires a model element owner see issue p remark mvw why not give it an owner instead ? the activitygraph is the obvious candidate  or maybe the top state author mkl
Arg,positive,manages a progressmonitor dialog note users of this class should use the type of the interface link org argouml taskmgmt progressmonitor wherever possible to maintain gui independence author andrea nironi tigris org todo bob says i do not like the naming of this class its confusing that its called window and yet it is not a window lets rename once we have it hidden
Arg,positive,loads the project file and opens all kinds of error message windows if it does not work for some reason in those cases it preserves the old project param file the file to open param showui true if an error message may be shown to the user  false if run in commandline mode param pmw the progressmonitor to be updated if not needed  use null return true if the file was successfully opened todo separate this into a swing specific class tfm

Arg,positive,todo can we move this knowledge behind model facade rather than have a condition here ?
Arg,positive,a command to set selected figs to their minimum size p despite its name  really the minimum size is selected here  p todo rename this class author markus klink
Arg,positive,this fig is never placed on a diagram it is only used by the call renderer so that pick list items look like diagram figs todo this fig does not represent a model element and so it should not extend fignodemodelelement we should split fignodemodelelement in two  one for base functionality for all nodes and one that is truly for model elements
Arg,positive,todo why is this code even getting called for a figgeneralization ?
Arg,positive,class to manage project related actions which need to be  or historically have been  managed as singletons todo it is unclear to me whether all of these actually have to be managed as singletons  but for now i 've just moved them from projectbrowser as is tfm author tom morris
Arg,positive,todo this should not know the internal form of type names  but i'm not sure what gef is predicatetype does  so i'm fixing it here tfm
Arg,positive,todo move to different class ?
Arg,positive,i hate this so much even before i start writing it re initialising a global in a place where no one will see it just feels wrong oh well  here goes
Arg,positive,todo this should not know the internal form of type names  but i'm not sure what gef is predicatetype does  so i'm fixing it here tfm
Arg,positive,todo should fire its own event and projectbrowser should register a listener
Arg,positive,kludge required by gef is use of hashmap in the api todo this can be removed if they ever fix gef to use maps
Arg,positive,critique menu todo this dependency should be inverted with the critics subsystem registering its desired shortcuts with us tfm
Arg,positive,genericargomenubar defines the menu bar for all operating systems which do not explicitly ask for a different kind of menu bar  such as mac os x p menu is and the mnemonics of menu is and the menuitems are separated in the propertyresourcebundle em menu properties em p menu items are separated in the propertyresourcebundle em action properties em p the key is in menu properties have the following structure pre menu file name of menu e g menu file mnemonics of menu is file name of menu mnemonic e g menu file mnemonic mnemonics of menuitems file flag for item name of menuitem mnemonic e g menu item new mnemonic pre todo add registration for new menu items deprecated in  by bob tarling this class will be moved and made private in future use menubarfactory createapplicationmenubar
Arg,positive,forwards this event to the tree model param element the modelelement to be changed todo this should not be public components desiring to inform the explorer of changes should send events
Arg,positive,todo delete should be available on any combination of model elements and diagrams todo should not be creating a new instance here we should hold the delete action in some central place
Arg,positive,adds the entry to the mru list param filename of the project todo this should listen for file save events rather than being called directly tfm
Arg,positive,todo make sure this should not go into a previous condition tml
Arg,positive,todo should not be creating a new instance here we should hold the delete action in some central place
Arg,positive,the tree structure has changed significantly inform the associated tree model todo this should not be public components desiring to inform the explorer of changes should send events deprecated by mvw in v use events instead
Arg,positive,todo we really only care about events which affect things that are visible in the current perspective  view  this could be tailored to cut down on event traffic tfm
Arg,positive,the singleton instance todo why is this a singleton ? would not it be better to have exactly one for every explorer ?
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo we need a factory pattern for goxxx classes that can determine if they are required
Arg,positive,todo we need a factory pattern for goxxx classes that can determine if they are required
Arg,positive,todo can this be made more restrictive ? do we care about any attributes other than name ? tfm
Arg,positive,this is carried over from previous implementation not sure why we do not want contents of package tfm
Arg,positive,todo any namespace can contain other elements why do not we allow this ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo really should be element modelelement  but we do not have a type which is portable for this
Arg,positive,todo this method can be replaced by getclass getsimplename when argo drops support for java versions
Arg,positive,see org argouml cognitive critic setheadline  java lang string  set up the locale specific text for the critic headline  the one liner that appears in the to do pane  and the critic description  the detailed explanation that appears in the to do tab of the details pane  mvw maybe we can make it part of the constructor cruml ? fixme why override if nobody uses ?
Arg,positive,set the threshold todo should this be protected ? param threshold the threshold to compare to
Arg,positive,these may not actually make any difference at present  the code behind addtrigger needs more work
Arg,positive,todo split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly in this class
Arg,positive,todo do we need this generalization is not a named element
Arg,positive,these may not actually make any difference at present  the code behind addtrigger needs more work
Arg,positive,needed ?
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,find all the figs that visualise the given model element in this layer  or null if there is none todo once gef includes this same method in diagram then this can go see org tigris gef base diagram presentationsfor  java lang object
Arg,positive,todo this uses a last one wins algorithm for registration we should warn if a factory is being overwritten
Arg,positive,gets font name if it does not exist in configuration it creates new entries in configuration for appearance todo why create in a getter ? return the name of the configured font
Arg,positive,todo what is this trying to do ? it is never going to get called tfm really dirty hack to remove unwanted listeners
Arg,positive,todo this should not be referencing the current project instead the appropriate undomanager should have already been retrieved from the correct project
Arg,positive,todo needs to be tidied up after stable release graph model should be created in constructor
Arg,positive,todo we should be given an undo manager to use rather than looking for a global one
Arg,positive,todo replace the next deprecated call this case is complicated by the use of parameters all other figs work differently
Arg,positive,class to display graphics for a uml choice state in a diagram the circle todo this should really be renamed figchoicestate it is the last vestige of the uml name author pepargouml
Arg,positive,todo needs to be tidied up after stable release graph model should be created in constructor
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo what is this needed for ? tfm
Arg,positive,the next  lines fix the nd half of issue  is there no better way ?
Arg,positive,return a list of gravity points around circle which is enclosed in the bounding box convenience method for use by figinitialstate and figfinalstate todo as this method is not required by all sub classes  it would seem sensible to extend figstatevertex with figcirclevertex and only have the relevant concrete figs extend that and gain this functionality return a list of points
Arg,positive,to resize only when a new concurrent region is added  changing the height todo probably should not exist as this class should be listening for added concurrent regions and call this internally itself param h the new height
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo are not our items always strings ? tfm
Arg,positive,actually instanciate the netnode and fignode objects and set the global next mode to modeplace todo should call super  reduce code volume  see org tigris gef graph graphfactory makenode
Arg,positive,todo this logic may well be worth moving into the model component provide a similar grid to the connectionsgrid
Arg,positive,todo ? if this class listen the model  it will be able to change in live as it is done in the figs  diagram
Arg,positive,todo redo it  curbody should be as long as curlanguage button
Arg,positive,todo needs to be tidied up after stable release graph model should be created in constructor
Arg,positive,when we change the type  we need to create a new initial value and to display the panel todo if we select the same type that the current  do nothing
Arg,positive,todo we definitely do not want to react to addition and removal of transitions ca not we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener
Arg,positive,the target model element in uml x this is the element that owns the expression in uml x this is the expression itself todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses should be considered
Arg,positive,field todo textarea or textfield
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo this can be a mess there are any better solution ?
Arg,positive,todo use it notify set to true to forward events to model only one of language and body fields should have this set to true
Arg,positive,todo if this is an ordered list  then you have to add in the right location
Arg,positive,see java beans propertychangelistener propertychange  java beans propertychangeevent  todo this should be reviewed to see if it can be improved with a view towards removing some of the overrriding methods used as workarounds for differences between nsuml and mdr tfm
Arg,positive,todo this is a redundant invocation
Arg,positive,get all classifiers in our model todo we need the property panels to have some reference to the project they belong to instead of using deprecated functionality
Arg,positive,todo copied from umldiagramrenderer get the fignode from the given layer that represents the given model element the fignode portion of an association class is returned in preference to the figedge portion if no fignode is found then a figedge is searched for and the fignode that acts as its edge port is returned param lay the layer containing the fig param modelelement the model element to find presentation for return the fignode presentation of the model element
Arg,positive,todo build a return parameter
Arg,positive,todo getallpossiblesubvertices and getallsubstates are duplicates tfm
Arg,positive,todo how to merge multiple inheritance ? necessary ? this currently copies the common ancestors multiple times
Arg,positive,todo this ca not depend on projectbrowser alternate below
Arg,positive,todo this is a composite association  so these will get deleted automatically the only thing we need to do is check for any additional elements that need to be deleted as a result
Arg,positive,todo this is well formedness rule from uml  no generalizableelement can have a parent generalization to an element that is a leaf self parent forall  s not s isleaf
Arg,positive,check arguments against parameters for type and number todo perhaps move this to a critic instead ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo add standard stereotype ? set is open ended  but predefined names include call  create  instantiate  send
Arg,positive,todo is there anyway we can determine this size at runtime ?
Arg,positive,todo taken from figclassifierboxwithattribute to handle events on an attribute all this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment fig for attributes
Arg,positive,we are getting events we do not want filter them out todo can we instruct the model event pump not to send these in the first place ? see defect  param event the event
Arg,positive,modelimpl getfacade getrootelements gets all root elements in the uml repository  including available profiles that are not part of the current project  degrades performance  projectmanager getmanager getcurrentproject getroots only returns user model roots  and no profiles projectmanager getmanager getcurrentproject getmodels gets all root models  but no root namespaces todo which is best ? is there any other way ?
Arg,positive,todo as currently coded  this actually returns all behavioralfeatures which are owned by classifiers contained in the given namespace  which is slightly different then what is documented it will not include any behavioralfeatures which are part of the namespace  but which do not have an owner
Arg,positive,todo performance consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear at this point instead
Arg,positive,delete a model element implements 'cascading delete' to make sure model is still valid after element has been deleted p the actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the factories for example a method deleteclass exists on corehelper delete methods as deleteclass should only do those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself i e deleteclass should only take care of things specific to umlclass p the delete methods in the uml factories should not be called directly throughout the code  calls should always refer to this method and never call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly the reason that it is possible to call the deletexxx methods directly is a pure implementation detail p the implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if then else tree this is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the uml metamodel the last remark refers to the fact that the uml model uses multiple inheritance in several places this has to be taken into account p todo the requirements of the metamodel could probably be better determined by reflection on the metamodel then each association that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure that it meets the requirements and  if not  be deleted tfm p extensions and its children are not taken into account here they do not require extra cleanup actions not in the form of a call to the remove method as is normal for all children of mbase and not in the form of other behaviour we want to implement via this operation param elem the element to be deleted see org argouml model umlfactory delete  java lang object
Arg,positive,do not allow connections to be created from a read only model element to any other todo this should be considered a workaround it only works because  by default  we place newly created relationships in the namespace of the fromelement the correct behavior in the presence of read only elements really depends on the type of connection as well as the writeability of both ends
Arg,positive,todo taken from figclassifierboxwithattribute to handle events on an attribute all this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment fig for attributes
Arg,positive,an array of valid connections  the combination of connecting class and node classes must exist as a row in this list to be considered valid ul li the st column is the connecting element li the nd column is the from element type li the rd column is the to element type the rd column is optional  if not given then it is assumed to be the same as the from element li the existence of a th column indicates that the connection is valid in one direction only ul todo this encodes not only what is legal in uml  but also what argouml knows how to create  so not all legal connections are included probably should be split into two pieces legal uml  here  and supported  in argouml application someplace  tfm  p see also issue  p most of these are subtypes of relationship which includes association  dependency  flow  generalization  extend  and include dependency includes binding  abstraction  usage  and permission associationrole and associationclass are associations the remaining items  link  transition  associationend  message  are non relationship types which argouml treats as connections edges
Arg,positive,todo check for duplicates  is this possible ? ? ?
Arg,positive,todo we also have code registering for the names of a tagged value like derived
Arg,positive,recursive method to get all subtypes todo does this have a scalability problem ?
Arg,positive,todo bob says we should not be listening here for addition and removal of attributes this should be done in figattributescompartment
Arg,positive,do not wait on ourselves  we will deadlock  todo we might want to throw an exception here
Arg,positive,todo must we calculate the whole list ?
Arg,positive,todo replace this recursive function by a loop like in getroot
Arg,positive,todo because we get called on each and every change event  when the model is in a state of flux  we will often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection the only saving grace is that we 're called so many times that on the last time  things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update we need a better mechanism
Arg,positive,updates a compartment box called from updatelayout if there is a model event effecting the attributes operations and from renderingchanged in all cases todo the above statement means that the entire contents of the compartments are being rebuilt whenever an add remove of an attribute  operation or a reception is detected it would be better to have compartments listen for add and remove events and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild remark mvw this is a bit exaggerated  since the populate method is already heavily optimized
Arg,positive,todo reconfigure exception handling to distinguish between errors that are possible due to bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors
Arg,positive,todo callers will need to be refactored to work around the change in the way multiplicities work tfm
Arg,positive,and its stereotypes todo are not stereotypes handled elsewhere ?
Arg,positive,todo because we get called on each and every change event  when the model is in a state of flux  we will often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection the only saving grace is that we 're called so many times that on the last time  things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update we need a better mechanism
Arg,positive,todo some elements such as generalization are no longer named for a transitional period we will return a string so debug can continue  but the calling code should probably be fixed tfm  bob says these are the comments that were in facadeeumlimpl getname same trick is needed here for now
Arg,positive,map of which resources are read only p todo this needs to be managed per editingdomain
Arg,positive,todo mvw would it not be better if this code would go in starttexteditor  not overruling mouseclicked but we made this fig not editable  to stop it from reacting on key presses anyhow this is a hack abusing a figtext gef does not really support double clicking on a fig to trigger some action
Arg,positive,todo does corehelper getextendingclassifiers  object element  means all direct and indirect extending classifiers or only the direct extending classifiers ?
Arg,positive,todo this code appears to be designed to jump to the diagram containing the contents of the package that was double clicked but it looks like it is always searching for the name main instead of the package name todo but in any case  it should be delegating this work to to something that knows about the diagrams and they contents tfm
Arg,positive,todo what is the behavior of this in the case of nested models ?
Arg,positive,todo is this returning extended elements or base classes ?
Arg,positive,todo instancespecification classifier association is not navigable in this direction
Arg,positive,a model element has been removed from this packages namespace if the fig representing that model element is on the same diagram as this package then make sure it is not enclosed by this package todo in my view the fig representing the model element should be removed from the diagram yet to be agreed bob
Arg,positive,todo seems to work only with both loops  check why
Arg,positive,todo this needs to be double checked tfm
Arg,positive,used by pgml tee return the class name and bounds together with compartment visibility todo is this not duplicate with the parent ?
Arg,positive,this node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other fignodes in argouml it is actually an optional child fig  or more precisely a path item  of a figedgemodelelement this allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a comment to some other edge type gef can only attach edges to nodes  by making this fig both a node and containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge connections todo we are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we do not really require we should attempt to make figedgeport extend fignode author bob tarling
Arg,positive,todo this is a temporary crutch to use until all figs are updated to use the constructor that accepts a diagramsettings object
Arg,positive,searches for a stereotype just like the given stereotype in all given models  and their sub namespaces  the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet otherwise it will be returned itself  todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter  but a name and a baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass p todo should it only search for stereotypes owned by the model object ? param models a collection of models param stereo is the given stereotype return stereotype
Arg,positive,finds a stereotype in a given namespace  and all those in any sub namespace of the given namespace returns null if no such stereotype is found p todo what if stereo getname or stereo getbaseclass is null ? then you know immediately that none will be found  but is that the correct answer ? currently  null is returned in these cases p todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter  but a name and a baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass p todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is equal to the given one inheritance does not work return the stereotype found or null param ns is the namespace param stereo is the stereotype
Arg,positive,creates a uml model element of the given type this only works for uml elements if a diagram contains elements of another type then it is the responsibility of the diagram manage those items and not call this method it also only works for uml model elements that are represented in diagrams by a node param elementtype the type of model element to build return the model element todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,builds a compositestate as top for some statemachine p todo confusing name this method should better be named buildtopstateonstatemachine param statemachine the given statemachine return mcompositestate the newly build top state see buildcompositestate  object
Arg,positive,todo mvw this needs rethinking rework  i have the following questions why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used ? ie  why is there not a getstereotype  string name  string baseclass  ?  edited by dmst
Arg,positive,todo this functionality is in the worn place we should be able to call setvisible on the compartment itself and then this class should react to that event improvements will follow in later releases hence this method should not be considered stable for module developers param compartment the compartment to be changed param isvisible true if the attribute compartment is visible
Arg,positive,todo this should become private and only called from constructor see org argouml uml diagram ui figcompartment populate
Arg,positive,remove all items in the group  otherwise the model event listeners remain todo why does a figgroup not do this ?
Arg,positive,todo in uml  classifierrole  associationrole  and associationendrole have been replaced by the internal structure of the collaboration
Arg,positive,todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here i can see something like this is needed though as events wo not manage this quick enough could we make figeditablecompartment createmodelelement create the new child fig instance ? it may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return bob
Arg,positive,todo is this needed correct ? for when all compartments are hidden ?
Arg,positive,this tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when importing if it is set  then the critics could ignore those objects if they want todo this is really belongs in a higher level utility class that uses the facade is tagged value methods also  it needs to be updated to use a uml tagdefinition instead of a simple string
Arg,positive,recognizer for n ary association todo this is not a recognizer for some type rename to isnaryassociation ? param handle candidate return true if handle is an association
Arg,positive,todo is this needed ?
Arg,positive,builds an interface with a given name param name is the given name return interface todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,builds a default implementation for an interface the interface is not owned by any model element by default users should not forget to add ownership return interface todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,check if labels etc have been hit apparently gef does require pathitems to be annotations which ours are not  so until that is resolved
Arg,positive,create an empty but initialized instance of a uml templateparameter return an initialized uml templateparameter instance todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,builds a default implementation for a class the class is not owned by any model element by default users should not forget to add ownership return newly created class todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,create an empty but initialized instance of a uml usage return an initialized uml usage instance todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,create an empty but initialized instance of a uml permission return an initialized uml permission instance todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created deprecated for  by tfmorris renamed in uml  x to packageimport use link createpackageimport
Arg,positive,create an empty but initialized instance of a uml permission return an initialized uml permission instance todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where the new element should be created
Arg,positive,action to add a stereotype to a model element todo appears to be unused ? author bob tarling deprecated for  by tfmorris use link org argouml uml actionaddstereotype
Arg,positive,returns the destination of a relation or link the destination of a relation is defined as the modelelement that receives this relation if there are more then  destinations  only the first is returned if there is no destination  null is returned examples of sources include classifiers that are types to associationends  usecases that are bases to extend and include relations and so on in the case of an association  the destination is defined as the type of the second element in the connections list p todo move this method to a generic modelhelper param relationship is the relation return object
Arg,positive,return the source of a relation or link the source of a relation is defined as the modelelement that propagates this relation if there are more then  sources  only the first is returned if there is no source  null is returned examples of sources include classifiers that are types to associationends  usecases that are bases to extend and include relations and so on a source is always the start from the arrow in the fig  the destination the end p todo move this method to a generic modelhelper param relationship is the relation return object
Arg,positive,sets the language of an expression todo this operation is fooling the user in thinking that the body of the object is changed instead  a new object is created there is no other way a mexpression can not be altered  once created  so  this operation returns a newly created object instead param handle the expression param language the new language return the newly created object
Arg,positive,todo remove the casting to diagramfactoryinterface as soon as diagramfactoryinterface is removed
Arg,positive,todo having critics actions here introduces an unnecessary dependency on the critics subsystem have it register its desired actions using an extension mechanism tfm
Arg,positive,true if an instance is allowed to be invisible this is currently only set true by figedgeport todo figedgeport should be removed from the fignodemodelelement hierarchy and so the need for this removed
Arg,positive,todo we really want this class to have package scope however the reflection
Arg,positive,todo there are lots and lots of magic numbers used in calculating positions and sizes any time you see figs being placed at  use these constants instead if you can reliably interpret calculations  you can factor them out of there as well add additional constants as needed to express other common factors tfm
Arg,positive,name is set to the empty string  yuck by default fix it
Arg,positive,todo note copy paste code in figexitpoint where is this code better placed in gef ?
Arg,positive,todo remove the casting to diagramfactoryinterface as soon as diagramfactoryinterface is removed
Arg,positive,find a model element in modelelements which name is equal to name param name the name of the model element to find it ca not be null param modelelements the link collection of model elements in which to find a model element with name return the model element if found or null todo maybe should be moved to a helper class that deals with model related stuff
Arg,positive,todo we should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default this depends on the default profile configuration containing the type integer to test properly otherwise it will get created in the main project  defeating the purpose
Arg,positive,called by propertychanged when it detects that a stereotype has been added or removed on removal the fignode removes its listener to that stereotype when a new stereotype is detected we add a listener todo bob says in my opinion we should not be doing this here figstereotype should always be listening to change of its owners name figstereotypescompartment should always be listening for add or remove of stereotypes to its owner those classes will need to pass some event to the fignode on the awt thread only if a change results in a change of size that requires a redraw p note runs at the model  mdr  thread p param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change
Arg,positive,todo do we want the top level package here instead of the immediate parent ?
Arg,positive,todo this creates a dependency on the critics subsystem we need a generic way for modules  including our internal subsystems  to request addition of actions to the popup menu tfm
Arg,positive,this is a template method called by the argouml framework as the result of a change to a model element do not call this method directly yourself p override this in any subclasses in order to change what model elements the fignode is listening to as a result of change to the model p p this method is guaranteed by the framework to be running on the same thread as the model subsystem p todo lets refactor this at some time to take umlchangeevent argument param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change

Arg,positive,fix up bad figs p due to errors in earlier releases of argouml it can happen that there is a generalization without a child or parent p todo move into xsl we should not remove from the graph model while we 're writing to it or we have a possible cause of concurrent modification exception param owner
Arg,positive,todo the above does not work reliably in a constructor we need a better way of getting default fig settings for the owning project rather than using the project manager singleton tfm
Arg,positive,defines the methods to generate source code from the model each class providing code generation functionality must implement this to be recognized by argouml as a code generator p todo a gui independent mechanism to pass settings to the code generator is needed similar to what we have for reverse engineering see link org argouml uml reveng importinterface getimportsettings and link org argouml uml reveng settingstypes since when it replaced the filegenerator interface

Arg,positive,see java awt event actionlistener actionperformed  java awt event actionevent  todo from combobox javadoc this method is public as an implementation side effect do not call or override we should find some other way to implement this
Arg,positive,todo this should not know about the specific type of fig that is being displayed that couples it too strongly to things it should not need to know about tfm
Arg,positive,todo this is a temporary method of making sure the model is updated on loss of focus of a combo box in the long term we should attempt to update the model on each keypress see java awt event focuslistener focuslost  java awt event focusevent
Arg,positive,the model for the table with the tagged values implementation for uml and tagdefinitions todo this currently only supports taggedvalues with a tagdefinition which has a type of string
Arg,positive,todo use our extension registration mechanism for our internal classes as well  so everything is treated the same
Arg,positive,todo we should really be passing the default settings to the diagram factory so they get set at creation time
Arg,positive,idem  e g for a generalization with leaf root object todo but showing the message in the statusbar would help todo illegalargumentexception should not be used for events we expect to happen we need a different way of catching well formedness rules

Arg,positive,todo we 'd like these to not be filled  but gef wo not let us select them if we do that setfilled  false
Arg,positive,gef methods todo these should really be picked up automatically from some gef interface that we extend  but there is no such thing note we 've only added methods used by argouml  so it is possible that external consumers need other methods
Arg,positive,abstract class that is the parent of all actions adding diagrams to argouml the children of this class should implement creatediagram to do any specific actions for creating a diagram and isvalidnamespace that checks if some namespace is valid to add the diagram to p argouml shall never create a diagram for a read only modelelement p todo this class should be merged with actionnewdiagram author jaap branderhorst xsall nl

Arg,positive,we hang our heads in shame there are still bugs in argouml and or gef that cause corruptions in the model before a save takes place we repair the model in order to be as certain as possible that the saved file will reload todo split into small inner classes for each fix return a text that explains what is repaired
Arg,positive,todo the reference to the method org argouml uml ui vetoablepropertychange getvetomessage  string  was here but the class does exist anymore where is it ? this method is never used  param propertyname is the name of the property return a message or null if not applicable
Arg,positive,execute this action from the command line todo the underlying gef library relies on acme that does not allow us to create these files unless there is a window showing for this reason i have had to split the performing of commands in link org argouml application main main  string  so that we can  by not supplying the batch option  run these commands with the window showing hopefully this can eventually be fixed see org argouml application api commandlineinterface docommand  string  param argument is the file name that we save to return true if it is ok

Arg,positive,todo this should get the containing project from the list of targets  not from some global
Arg,positive,todo bob says this is a really nasty horrible hack shadowfig should not extend fignodemodelelement instead we require a base class fignode with common behaviour of all nodes in argouml shadowfig should extend that and fignodemodelelement should extend that same base class adding common functionality for fignode that represent model element see org argouml uml diagram ui fignodemodelelement setshadowsize  int
Arg,positive,a window that displays an exception to the user if we ca not handle it in any other way todo this has been partly converted to be a generic error dialog rather than something specific to exceptions this should be renamed when that process is complete

Arg,positive,this can be made public to allow others to extend their own persisters
Arg,positive,once all edges are connected do a compute route on each to make sure that annotations and the edge port is positioned correctly only do this after all edges are connected as compute route requires all edges to be connected to nodes todo it would be nice not to have to do this and restore annotation positions instead

Arg,positive,throws saxexception when things go wrong with sax throws ioexception when there is an io error throws parserconfigurationexception when the parser finds wrong syntax todo unused ?
Arg,positive,since this is  hopefully  a temporary solution  and nobody ever looks at the type of notation event  we can simplify from sending every existing event to one event only but since there is no catch all event defined  we just make one up rationale reduce the number of total refreshes of the drawing
Arg,positive,prefix identified as an implementation specific class todo this should be generalized so it does not have to be changed each time a new implementation is created tfm

Arg,positive,the project interface encapsulates all information about a designer is project it contains the list of diagrams and uml models  various project properties such as the author is name  and defaults for various settings p todo this interface was mechanically refactored from the implementation class link projectimpl it needs to be reviewed and cleaned up  eliminating methods which should be part of the public api and splitting the interface into smaller function specific  e g trashcan  interfaces author tom morris tfmorris gmail com  thomas neustupny since  when it replaced the concrete class of the same name
Arg,positive,todo this should listen for new target events fired by wizstep updatetabtodo so that we can decouple it from the projectbrowser

Arg,positive,agency manages critics since classes are not really first class objects in java  a singleton instance of agency is made and passed around as needed the agency keeps a registry of all critics that should be applied to each type of design material when a design material instance is critiqued it asks agency to apply all registered critic is in the current scheme there is a thread that proactively  continuously critiques the design at hand  even if the user is idle  this is simple and it works the disadvantage is that all active critics related to a given design material are applied  regardless of the reason for the critiquing and a lot of cpu time is basically wasted p todo i am moving toward a more reactionary scheme in which specific design manipulations in the editor cause critics relevant to those manipulations to be applied this transition is still half done triggers are the critiquing requests the code for triggers is currently dormant  latent ?  p todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently  perhaps using an interface to break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem  creating strong coupling throughout tfm  author jason robbins
Arg,positive,reply true iff this critic is relevant to the goals that the designer is trying to achieve by default  all critic is are relevant regardless of the goalmodel really this is something for a controlmech to compute  but if a subclass of critic encapsulates some information you may need to override this method p todo i would like a better default action  but goals are typed and their values must be interpreted by critics they are not as generic as the decisionmodel param dsgr the designer return true if relevant
Arg,positive,todo this is a hack a much better way of doing this would be not to start the critic in the first place
Arg,positive,return true iff the given todoitem is still valid and should be kept in the given designers todolist critics that are not enabled should always return false so that their todoitems will be removed subclasses of critic that supply multiple offenders should always override this method p by default this method basically asks the critic to again critique the offending object and then it checks if the resulting todoitem is the same as the one already posted this is simple and it works fine for light weight critics critics that expend a lot of computational effort in making feedback that can be easily check to see if it still holds  should override this method p todo maybe todoitem should carry some data to make this method more efficient inheritdoc
Arg,positive,the decisionmodel is part of the state of the designer it describes what types of decisions  or design issues  the designer is thinking about at the current time critics that are relevant to those decisions are made active  critics that are not relevant are made inactive todo there is some notion that each decision has a certain importanance at a certain time  but i have not followed through on that because i do not have good examples of how to quantify the importance of a decision todo right now the individual decisions are just strings  maybe they should have some non atomic structure ? author jason robbins
Arg,positive,how much control should critics have over when they are relavant ? does doing that in code instead of declaratively limit reasoning ? how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization ?
Arg,positive,this class models the designer who is building a complex design in some application domain and needs continuous feedback to aid in the making of good design decisions p strong this area needs work  especially as it is a central idea of argo strong p currently  almost  everything is hardcoded what can be configurable ? ? p the todolist is dependent on this class  i e each designer has its todolist p each designer has his own agency  which is the only class that knows all the critics p this class listens to property changes from ? p a designer can create todo items  just like the critics hence the designer implements the poster interface p todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer they either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently  perhaps using an interface to break the cycle the designer singleton gets passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem  creating strong coupling throughout tfm  author jason robbins
Arg,positive,return the default type for a parameter return a classifier to use as the default type todo this belongs in projectsettings tfm
Arg,positive,todo at the moment setselectedcomponent does not take into account the rather complex tab selection mechanism of detailspane the tab selection mechanism must be refactored
Arg,positive,todoitems that the designer has explicitly indicated that  s  he considers resolved p todo generalize into a design rationale logging facility
Arg,positive,todo settext in gef should call setbounds instead of directly changing x  y  w  h then we will have an event generated correctly in gef
Arg,positive,handle firing a notation event p todo this needs to be managed on a per diagram or per project basis param event the event to be fired param listener the listener

Arg,positive,handle firing a diagram appearance event p todo this needs to be managed on a per diagram or per project basis param event the event to be fired param listener the listener
Arg,positive,todo this is currently duplicated from metadatacache must find a common place in model facade
Arg,positive,todo once we have fixed all subclasses the title will always be localized so this localization can be removed
Arg,positive,andreas this is just temporary for the uml pre alpha versions
Arg,positive,sets the body of an expression todo this operation is fooling the user in thinking that the body of the object is changed instead  a new object is created there is no other way a mexpression can not be altered  once created  so  this operation returns a newly created object instead param handle the expression to modify param body the body to set return the newly created expression

Arg,positive,this is a temporary hack until the notation provider for a sd message will be able to parse successfully when the sequence number is missing remove this method completely then
Arg,positive,todo calcbounds is called by selectionmanager when the fig is dragged this code is needed to reposition any self message as they are become detached from their classifier role  see issue the cause of the detachment is not yet understood unfortunately calcbounds is called from several other places so the code here is not optimal but is the best workaround until argouml can provide its own replacement selectionmanager for sequence diagram requirements see http gef tigris org issues show bug cgi ? id

Arg,positive,convert to bounding box very screwy  gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text at the nominal baseline which is well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly
Arg,positive,this is the interface for registering interest in events sent from the model component p neither the registration or unregistration  nor the events themselves contain any reference to the model implementation instead they use the link java beans propertychangelistener  link java beans propertychangeevent to deliver events p the reference to the listener is a weakreference so you do not need to call removewhateverlistener  you can just forget about your listener and it is eventually finalized and removed this also means that you will have to keep a reference to your listener while it is active since the garbage collecting mechanism is not really deterministic a forgotten about listener might still receive events unless it can handle them in a harmless way  this approach should not be used todo  is this still true or does it refer to the nsuml implementation ? tfm  this is part of the contract that is established between the model subsystem and its users if that is not fulfilled by the current implementation  then the current implementation is incorrect linus p todo what event names ? the event names generated are link string s and their values and meanings are not really well documented in general they are the name of an an association end or attribute in the uml metamodel p here are some highlights ul li remove event sent when the element is removed ul author linus tolke

Arg,positive,return the tagged value with a specific tag p warning this method returns only the first taggedvalue found with the given name hence  this method is a simplification of the real problem and should be avoided todo what should be done about the above problem ? options are to deprecate the method  throw an exception if the name is ambiguous  or leave the caller to figure it out themselves param handle the model element the tagged value belongs to param name the tag name return the found tag  null if not found
Arg,positive,todo is this removed from uml ?
Arg,positive,todo some of these magic numbers probably assume a line width of  replace with appropriate constants variables

Arg,positive,todo we do not want to do this once we have dropped uml  map uml names to uml equivalents
Arg,positive,todo comment by a rueckert i do not think it makes much sense to query interactions from a collaboration in uml  since this diagram does no longer exist and an interaction means something different in uml
Arg,positive,todo comment by a rueckert a rueckert gmx net i think  the handle holding the collaboration implementation  should rather be a collaborationuse in uml but as a workaround for now  i will try to get a collaboration representation  collaborationuse  and then try to get the owning classifier from there
Arg,positive,todo this probably ca not be implemented in a way that will make the uml ui happy needs to be generalized to uml  semantics
Arg,positive,todo what do we want to use as an equivalent here ?

Arg,positive,todo this does not belong in the implementation specific piece tfm
Arg,positive,todo the javadoc specifies that null should be returned if 'from' or 'to' are null or if there are no associations between them we should return an empty collection instead and the javadoc should be changed
Arg,positive,todo this is not right
Arg,positive,todo support more than one body language
Arg,positive,todo does corehelper getextendedclassifiers  object element  means all parents  direct and indirect  or only the direct parents ?
Arg,positive,todo what is the purpose of this ? why do we hide buttons here ? presumably if so we should not assume selectionclass
Arg,positive,todo we currently delete the old values before setting to something new this is a workaround to issue  we should consider giving an api to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values
Arg,positive,todo in uml x event has no parameters the event metaclass in uml x corresponds to the trigger metaclass in uml x  see uml superstructure page
Arg,positive,todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml  x metamodel if not replaced by reflection

Arg,positive,workaround for missing ability to parse
Arg,positive,todo can we get this info from uml plugin ? perhaps collect all references in the metamodel  filter for those which represent containments and find the types on either end tfm
Arg,positive,todo use getmodelelementcontainer for transition
Arg,positive,todo we should not actually have to do all this work
Arg,positive,todo hook this creating of a new resource in to someplace more more appropriate  perhaps createmodel ?  better yet add a new method to model api to create a new top level project model xmi file so we do not depend on side effects
Arg,positive,todo check for resource to hold this and create if necessary ? this is a discrepancy between mdr which does it here and euml which does it as part of setrootmodel
Arg,positive,todo get setrootmodel are not specific to the model implementation they could probably be moved elsewhere tfm
Arg,positive,i think that the synchronized access to idtoobjectmaps is required in order to respect the thread safe nature of the object fixme maybe this should be moved into xmireferenceresolverimpl  because it depends on internal implementation details of it
Arg,positive,todo we can choose between something which matches uml in name or something that matches in functionality we 've chosen functionality for now  but this will create a name conflict during the migration process tfm
Arg,positive,todo change to throw exception when uses are fixed throw new notimplementedexception non nls
Arg,positive,a near clone of this code works fine outside of argouml  but throws a null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml i think it is something to do with the class libraries being used  but i ca not figure out what  so i 've done a simpler  less efficient stepwise translation below in serialtransform
Arg,positive,todo bob says coding by use of side effect here maybe this should be done in a clearer way but it fixes http argouml tigris org issues show bug cgi ? id  it seems that when loading an xmi that is not contained in a zip file then the inputstream given as the argument to this method ca not be reused as it is at the end of the stream in that case systemid appears to be none null at this stage so if systemid is not null we recreate the inputsource
Arg,positive,create temporary file for output todo we should be able to chain this directly to xmi reader
Arg,positive,xmiwriter implementation for mdr this implementation is clumsy because the specified writer interface wants characters  while the xmiwriter wants an outputstream dealing in bytes we could easily create a writer from an outputstream  but the reverse is not true todo the old writer based interface can be removed when the deprecated modelimplementation getxmiwriter is removed author lmaitre
Arg,positive,todo return empty collection on null input or throw illegalargument ?
Arg,positive,todo an iterator filter would be nice here instead of the mucking around with the collection
Arg,positive,todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality of  if we allow it we at least need a critic to warn about it
Arg,positive,apply profile stereotype to make it a profile  our convention hack create that stereotype instead using the uml profile
Arg,positive,if systemid is a valid url  simply use it todo this causes a network connection attempt for profiles
Arg,positive,todo make this work when the given stereotype has more than one baseclass todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is equal to the given one inheritance does not work
Arg,positive,todo this should call the single namespace form getstereotype  it next stereo
Arg,positive,todo still not used  because in argouml string is hardwired
Arg,positive,todo mvw do we really look into super types of the stereotype  or should we be looking into super types of the baseclass ?
Arg,positive,todo using just the last piece of the id leaves the potential for name collisions if two linked files have the same name in different directories
Arg,positive,todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing all and then adding all tfm
Arg,positive,todo what type of validation can we do here on tagtype ?
Arg,positive,todo this can be simplified to just include  extend  setbase usecase  base
Arg,positive,anything not found is newly created  so return a null systemid indicating that it is in the parent document todo this assumption will be invalid if when we allow editing of linked sub models
Arg,positive,todo distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved at end of load and should be reported to user
Arg,positive,todo this assumes ranges are sorted is this true ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo is this adequate for finding profiles in java webstart jars ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo check whether this is really needed i think it is left over from an incomplete understanding of the magicdraw composition error problem tfm
Arg,positive,todo not sure whether the above is better in some cases  but the code below is better for both java web start and eclipse
Arg,positive,todo this returns a collection  not a single object is this what the callers expect ?
Arg,positive,todo this code manually processes the elementimports of a package  but we need to check whether mdr already does something similar automatically as part of its namespace processing tfm
Arg,positive,todo this has different semantics than everything else
Arg,positive,todo an iterator filter would be nice here instead of the mucking around with the collection
Arg,positive,todo this does not belong here use getimportedelement
Arg,positive,todo rationalize this with getmodelelementcontainer

Arg,positive,todo more is required here to support referencevalues
Arg,positive,todo what other non modelelement types do we need to handle here ?
Arg,positive,todo this assumes ranges are sorted is this true ? tfm
Arg,positive,this causes problems it can make multiple return messages refer to the same activator even if not returning to the same classifier role as the activator emenates from i'm not sure that changing the activator of one message should amend any other messages but this is certainly changing too many bob
Arg,positive,todo in this needs to be localized  but we do not have any localization capabilities in the model subsystem object args typename  elemname  alias misc name element import alias imported alias  return translator localize  misc name element import alias  args
Arg,positive,register a listener for metamodel class  and all its subclasses optionally qualified by a list of property names todo verify that property event names are legal for this class in the metamodel
Arg,positive,todo do we want to construct an artificial name here ?
Arg,positive,todo implement support for types other than string
Arg,positive,todo this should be done after all events are delivered  but leave it here for now to avoid last minute synchronization problems
Arg,positive,only do verification if debug level logging is on todo should we leave this on always ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo mvw this needs rethinking rework  i have the following questions why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used ? ie  why is there not a getstereotype  string name  string baseclass  ?  edited by dmst  these comments imported from nsuml implementation tfm see org argouml model extensionmechanismsfactory buildstereotype  java lang object  java lang object  java lang object
Arg,positive,todo the type of the model element used in a type parameter  ie the formal  needs to match the actual parameter that it gets replaced with later this code is going to restrict that to always being a parameter which does not seem right  but i do not have time to debug it right now tfm
Arg,positive,todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml metamodel if not replaced by reflection
Arg,positive,todo a minimal update strategy would be better here to minimize work and events firing  but it may be better to deprecate the method and force calls to manage updates themselves  since they probably usually want to just add or remove a single element  tfm
Arg,positive,todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing everything and adding it again tfm
Arg,positive,todo this actually returns permissions with stereotypes of both access and import when the spec calls for only the former  but that seems to give different semantics to the way package imports work review to see which is wrong
Arg,positive,todo do we want to friend stereotypes too ? model getextensionmechanismshelper hasstereotype  permission  modelmanagementhelper friend stereotype
Arg,positive,todo we have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should be consolidated this form is used by org argouml uml reveng
Arg,positive,get elementresidences todo unused should be added to facade ? tfm param handle a modelelement return collection the elementresidence for this model element
Arg,positive,todo this is ambiguous as to whether it should be adding a container or resident
Arg,positive,todo this should either be extended to support all aggreationkinds or it should be simplified removed from the api tfm
Arg,positive,todo it does not really make sense that a namespace would be returned as part of its own contents  but that is the historical behavior
Arg,positive,todo perhaps use a hashset or other collection with faster lookup performance in case our callers are doing naive contains lookups
Arg,positive,todo try reusing the same set on every recursion
Arg,positive,check that the two elements are not already linked the opposite way todo this is a part implementation of well formedness rule uml  circular inheritance is not allowed not self allparents includes  self
Arg,positive,todo this is a part implementation of well formedness rule uml  circular inheritance is not allowed not self allparents includes  self
Arg,positive,todo this is not according the contract for this function  but it is used in several places  and i  mvw  presume that we need this generally this part  is about drawing an import permission between packages the part  below is about modelmanagement elementimport
Arg,positive,todo should we handle access and import ?

Arg,positive,todo this should probably throw an exception if it gets invalid arguments rather than just returning null
Arg,positive,todo delete old multiplicity ? why is copy using hard coded value ? tfm
Arg,positive,todo as currently implemented  this expects a list of multiplicityranges is this an interface change from the nsuml implementation ? i suspect it used to accept a list of integers tfm see org argouml model datatypesfactory createmultiplicity  java util list

Arg,positive,todo this is probably not the right location for switching off the filternewlines the setting gets lost after selecting a different modelelement in the diagram btw  see how it is used in javax swing text plaindocument see issue
Arg,positive,todo this can be a mess there are any better solution ?
Arg,positive,the list of operations shall contain all operations of all classifiers contained in the same package as the callaction itself p todo in fact  we also should include operations of imported clasifiers see org argouml uml ui umlcomboboxmodel buildmodellist

Arg,positive,creates a new field that selects the language for an expression param m expression model  should be shared between language and body fields param n only one of language and body fields should forward events to model todo mvw i do not understand that

Arg,positive,the constructor param expressionmodel expression model  should be shared between language and body fields param notify set to true to forward events to model only one of language and body fields should have this set to true todo mvw i do not understand that
Arg,positive,to simplify implementation  we list all associations found with any of the classifiers represented by the linked instances p todo make a foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations that create a correct model also take into account n ary associations and associationclasses this algo best goes in the model subsystem  e g in a method getallpossibleassociationsforalink see org argouml uml ui umlcomboboxmodel buildmodellist

Arg,positive,todo bob says the reflective code following should be replaced with something more specific like this commented out code this would mean we need stype changed to a meta type object rather than a string
Arg,positive,todo are the  methods uses ?
Arg,positive,an opaqueexpression can have n body n language when display to user  we only show one body a button is enabled for edit other todo can we  by import xmi  have  language body ? author laurent braud
Arg,positive,todo we have some quirk that the a baseclass addition or removal from a steroetype comes back as an attributechangeevent rather than an associationchangeevent this needs further investigation to see if this can be made consistent
Arg,positive,todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest otherwise we may still be acting on other events we do not need
Arg,positive,todo this needs work we also need to listen to addition removal of states to from a classifierinstate
Arg,positive,todo we may want to restrict the list to parameters which conform to the following wfr parameter type ofstype or  parameter kind in and ofstype allsupertypes includes  type or parameter kind out or parameter kind return  and type allsupertypes includes  ofstype or  parameter kind inout and  ofstype allsupertypes includes  type  or type allsupertypes includes  ofstype
Arg,positive,todo getallmodelelementsofkind should probably do this processing of imported elements automatically
Arg,positive,todo part of this is copied from actiondeletemodelelement we maybe need some subclass for common code
Arg,positive,todo we should really test the model instead for this but we have no api yet can we just check if the collection to build the jlist control implements the list interface ?
Arg,positive,see java awt event actionlistener actionperformed  java awt event actionevent  todo from combobox javadoc this method is public as an implementation side effect do not call or override we should find some other way to implement this

Arg,positive,this interface contains methods to retrieve objects that represent the different uml types these objects are use as tokens used to create model elements in some methods todo there are parts of argouml which assume that the objects returned here are classes we should formalize that by changing the return types to match tfm  bob says there should be no such assumption in argouml can we document where these are ? see org argouml model umlfactory buildconnection  object  object  object  object  object  object  object  see org argouml model umlfactory buildnode  object

EMF,positive,dms do a better job with specific exceptions ? just use chained runtimeexceptions ?
EMF,positive,if the delegate uri can be handled as a file we will hope that renaming it will be really efficient
EMF,positive,dms why not this ? new subprogressmonitor progressmonitor
EMF,positive,assume that it is an attribute for now it will could become a reference if the type resolves to an eclass

EMF,positive,only file scheme uris will be re encoded if a uri was decoded in the workaround above and platform resolve did not return a file scheme uri then this will return an decoded uri
EMF,positive,this functionality should eventually go away as it is replaced by model exporters we will just delegate to the deprecated genpackage method the monitor is not used so we wo not pass it
EMF,positive,the eannotations and egenerictype are possible containment references we will move them instead of copying
EMF,positive,note registry based authority is being removed from a new spec for uri which would obsolete rfc if the spec is added to xml errata processing of reg name needs to be removed mrglavas
EMF,positive,temporary structure to hold node is attributes namespaces in scope
EMF,positive,hack reading encoding
EMF,positive,because of the old factoring approach in the create method it might be the case that the state of the old value has changed by the time we get here and in that case we do not want to duplicate the removals in this code

EMF,positive,revisit remove this code store port value as string instead of integer

EMF,positive,bubble sort why ? in many cases this ranges has few elements
EMF,positive,per schema it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid uri for the future if we plant to support iris then it is better not to massage the initialvalue we should thought consider where would be the best way to validate anyuri values el
EMF,positive,note that the way they are sorted the values of index i always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list eatm todo we could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result

EMF,negative,set the editor is selection based on the current viewer is selection
EMF,negative,get the resource parent if its a file
EMF,negative,many inherited methods must be overridden to handle this case
EMF,negative,since we only use this right on an operation we always want to include the keytype and valuetype and we never want to qualify the property names
EMF,negative,if there are any arguments and they are not unbounded wildcards casts ca not be checked
EMF,negative,remove any menu items for old selection
EMF,negative,force an update because eclipse hides empty menus now
EMF,negative,we need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is built in and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value
EMF,negative,initialize all the fields from the command parameter
EMF,negative,tests generation
EMF,negative,check if the bound specifies a classifier
EMF,negative,if we change to pattern defaults will have to specify plain suffix in no main package case
EMF,negative,load the resource through the editing domain
EMF,negative,non nls non nls
EMF,negative,or we test their relationship via their instance classes if they have them
EMF,negative,some xml types declare nebulous object mappings they actually map to internal types that should not be generated into code
EMF,negative,this guards the switch
EMF,negative,make sure it is okay
EMF,negative,this is to handle a genmodel produced by rose genmodel
EMF,negative,if there is a base xml or ecore type use one of the two corresponding built in factories to create a value from the literal string
EMF,negative,clean up any old project information
EMF,negative,remove variables since the plugin xml should provide the complete path information
EMF,negative,look for a likely plugin name
EMF,negative,mappingimpl
EMF,negative,if we change to pattern defaults will have to specify plain suffix in no main package case
EMF,negative,clean up any old project information
EMF,negative,subclasses may override this method
EMF,negative,the bound is a wildcard with no constraints
EMF,negative,see if a genmodel is registered for the package is uri and if so try to load it
EMF,negative,the bound is a wildcard with no constraints
EMF,negative,if that did not work just synthesize one
EMF,negative,eatm foreign model
EMF,negative,any features from one package that delegate to features in another
EMF,negative,if there are features delegating across packages add only those that are not already being generated
EMF,negative,recompute the read only state
EMF,negative,a single separator possibly preceded by some parent reference segments is redundant
EMF,negative,an empty path needs to be replaced by a single if there is no query to distinguish it from a current document reference
EMF,negative,collapses non ending empty segments parent references and self references in a non relative path returning the same path that would be produced from the base hierarchical uri as part of a resolve
EMF,negative,we  ve either reached the end of the string the address ends in an ipv address or it is invalid scanhexsequence has already made sure that we have the right number of bits
EMF,negative,refresh any actions that may become enabled or disabled
EMF,negative,if the path is non empty and originally ended in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator
EMF,negative,typeconverterimpl
EMF,negative,returns a string representation of this uri for debugging explicitly showing each of the components
EMF,negative,add a listener to set the most recent command is affected objects to be the selection of the viewer with focus
EMF,negative,try to select the affected objects
EMF,negative,create the editing domain with a special command stack
EMF,negative,make sure it is okay
EMF,negative,if it is changing
EMF,negative,if the new prefix has segments it is not the root absolute path and we need to drop the trailing empty segment and append the tail segments
EMF,negative,do nothing
EMF,negative,featuremap add estructuralfeature cursor o expectedmodcount featuremap getmodcount entrycursor lastcursor lastcursor prepared
EMF,negative,create the listener on demand
EMF,negative,add all classes from this package first to guarantee they get the simple names
EMF,negative,this just notifies those things that are affected by the section
EMF,negative,do not even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix
EMF,negative,if the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too
EMF,negative,stop listening to the old one
EMF,negative,start listening to the new one
EMF,negative,remember it
EMF,negative,barring a better result this will be the result
EMF,negative,load the resource through the editing domain
EMF,negative,creates the model from the editor input
EMF,negative,the prefix really is a prefix of this if this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same
EMF,negative,only creates the other pages if there is something that can be edited
EMF,negative,do this here because getextendedmetadata is used during initialization and the mappings are are populated the first time it is fetched which will miss the packages we add as we initialize the tree
EMF,negative,create a page for the selection tree view
EMF,negative,public list sublist estructuralfeature feature int from int to return null
EMF,negative,rewriter is required for set methods
EMF,negative,ensures that this editor will only display the page is tab area if there are more than one page
EMF,negative,the content outline is just a tree
EMF,negative,ignore
EMF,negative,if we ca not add it it must already be in the list so find it and move it to the end
EMF,negative,both eobject and eobject are not null if eobject has been compared already
EMF,negative,if the target is read only we can ask the platform to release it
EMF,negative,range to look for comments
EMF,negative,create package meta data objects
EMF,negative,encodes the given string replacing each ascii character that is not in the set specified by the bit bitmask and each non ascii character below xa by an escape sequence of followed by two hex digits if is not in the set but ignoreescaped is true then will not be encoded iff it already begins a valid escape sequence
EMF,negative,tests whether an escape occurs in the given string starting at index i an escape sequence is a followed by two hex digits
EMF,negative,multiple jet directives
EMF,negative,there is no reason they are not equal so they are
EMF,negative,if the set states are the same and the values of the feature are the structurally equal they are equal
Hib,positive,this is only needed afaict for processing results from the query cache however this cannot possibly work in the case of discovered types
Hib,positive,note that this timestamp is not correct if the connection provider returns an older jdbc connection that was associated with a transaction that was already begun before opensession was called do not know any possible solution to this
Hib,positive,todo this is assertion is disabled because there is a bug that means the original owner of a transient uninitialized collection is not known if the collection is re referenced by a different object associated with the current session throw new assertionfailure bug loading unowned collection
Hib,positive,this does not support the cache sql  distinct by comma list   extensions but this extension is not supported through hibernate anyway
Hib,positive,todo when this is the entry point we should use an inner join for fetching the many to many elements
Hib,positive,could happen for custom criteria impls not likely but for long term solution see hhh
Hib,positive,todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object the owner of the association is not the owner of the id
Hib,positive,todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object
Hib,positive,todo entities can be compared by pk and entity name fix this
Hib,positive,todo does not work for entitymode dom j yet
Hib,positive,todo deal with the optional attribute in the join mapping this code assumes that optional defaults to true because it does not actually seem to work in the fetch join code note that actual proper handling of optional ality here is actually more involved than this patch assumes remember that we might have multiple join mappings associated with a single entity really a couple of things need to happen to properly handle optional here first and foremost when handling multiple join s we really should be using the entity root table as the driving table another option here would be to choose some non optional joined table to use as the driving table in all likelihood just using the root table is much simplier need to add the fk columns corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non optional data is present my initial thoughts on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new sequentialselect abstraction that actually gets generated in the persisters ok singletable and utilized here it would encapsulated all this required optional ality checking
Hib,positive,todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
Hib,positive,todo not really completely correct since the uoe could occur while resolving associations leaving the pc in an inconsistent state
Hib,positive,todo this is kinda inconsistent with collectiontype
Hib,positive,for a one to many a bag is not really a bag it is really a set since it ca not contain the same element twice it could be considered a bug in the mapping dtd that bag allows one to many
Hib,positive,todo entities can be compared by pk fix this only if when we can extract the id values
Hib,positive,todo old version did not require hashmap lookup keys collectionowner getidentifier
Hib,positive,todo this disables laziness even in non pojo entity modes
Hib,positive,todo at the point where we are resolving collection references we do not know if the uk value has been resolved depends if it was earlier or later in the mapping document now we could try and use e getstatus to decide to semiresolve trouble is that initializeentity reuses the same array for resolved and hydrated values
Hib,positive,todo currently we do not know a sessionfactory reference when building the tuplizer this is a bug embedded xml false on component todo fix this after hhh is complete
Hib,positive,todo this requires that the collection is defined after the referenced property in the mapping file ok ?
Hib,positive,todo currently we really do not handle valueinclusion partial valueinclusion partial would indicate parts of a component need to be included in the select currently we then just render the entire component into the select clause in that case
Hib,positive,todo is this completely correct ?
Hib,positive,todo what if batchupdate is a callablestatement ? calls executebatch
Hib,positive,this does not actually seem to work but it might work on some dbs also it does not work if there are multiple columns of results because it is not accounting for the suffix return new string getdiscriminatorcolumnname
Hib,positive,first validate all the enabled filters todo this implementation has bad performance
Hib,positive,todo passing null here because this method is not really used for dom j at the moment but it is still a bug if we do not get rid of this
Hib,positive,todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know the operand node type where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
Hib,positive,algorithm check for any level one nullability breaks look at non null components to recursively check next level of nullability breaks look at collections contraining component to recursively check next level of nullability breaks in the previous implementation not null stuffs where checked filtering by level one only updateable or insertable columns so setting a sub component as update false has no effect on not null check if the main component had good checkeability in this implementation we keep this feature however i never see any documentation mentioning that but it is for sure a limitation
Hib,positive,assume that the row was not there since it previously had only null values so do an insert instead todo does not respect dynamic insert
Hib,positive,todo this call will not work for anything other than pojos
Hib,positive,note that this implementation is kinda broken for components with many to one associations
Hib,positive,no need to take a snapshot this is a performance optimization but not really important except for entities with huge mutable property values
Hib,positive,todo this is broke for subqueries in statements other than selects
Hib,positive,the following types are not supported in rdms jdbc and therefore commented out however in some cases mapping them to character columns works for many applications but does not work for all cases
Hib,positive,todo should this be an error ?
Hib,positive,three general cases we check here as to whether to render a physical sql join is our parent a dotnode as well ? if so our property reference is being further de referenced is this a dml statement we were asked to generate any needed joins generatejoins true or we are currently processing a select or from clause an additional check is the regression style join suppression check solely intended for the test suite the regression style join suppression is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite this forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser the underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of cases the piece it generally tends to miss is that inner joins effect the results by further restricting the data set a particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit joins if the query is shallow the result being that query list and query iterate could return different number of results
Hib,positive,todo figure out how this should be set this was the reason for failures regarding index op and subclass joins on theta join dialects not sure what behaviour we were trying to emulate joinsequence joinsequence getfrompart emulate the old addfromonly behavior
Hib,positive,the preference here would be sqlfunctiontemplate hibernate timestamp current timestamp ? false but this appears not to work jay nance
Hib,positive,todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
Hib,positive,todo inexact what we really need to know is are any outer joins used ?
Hib,positive,todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
Hib,positive,todo not sure which either ? is correct could not find docs on how to do this did find various blogs and forums mentioning that select current timestamp does not work
Hib,positive,todo cannot use generatesuffixes it handles the initial suffix differently
Hib,positive,do not need this because we should never ever be selecting no columns in an insert select and because it causes a bug on db
Hib,positive,starts with an alias old style semi bad thing about this ca not re alias another alias
Hib,positive,todo bug this currently fails for named queries for non pojo entities
Hib,positive,fixme we do not have the associated entity table name here has to be done in a second pass
Hib,positive,this call is side effecty
Hib,positive,rdms does not directly support the trim function we use rtrim and ltrim
Hib,positive,note at least my local sql server express shows this not working
Hib,positive,note at least my local mysql install shows this not working
Hib,positive,use count as the default this mimics the old behavior although none might be a better option moving forward in the case of callable
Hib,positive,perhaps not really necessary
Hib,positive,todo what else to do here ?
Hib,positive,todo disable batch loading if lockmode read ?
Hib,positive,todo what else to do here ?
Hib,positive,todo to handle concurrent writes correctly the client should pass in a lock
Hib,positive,turn hibernate c p into c p so c p gets a chance to see all hibernate c p
Hib,positive,note there is a wierd implementation in the client side
Hib,positive,todo this was added to support initializing an entity is entityentry snapshot during reattach this should be refactored to instead expose a method to assemble a entityentry based on this state for return
Hib,positive,do we need to drop constraints before dropping tables in this dialect ?
Hib,positive,fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param props the configuration properties
Hib,positive,does this dialect support check constraints ?
Hib,positive,this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call start
Hib,positive,does this dialect support the unique column syntax ?
Hib,positive,this is done here  cos we might only know the type here ugly todo improve this a lot
Hib,positive,does this dialect support the for update syntax ?
Hib,positive,todo what is the implication of this ?
Hib,positive,todo yuck
Hib,positive,todo again how should this work for non pojo entities ?
Hib,positive,does this dialect support for update of allowing particular rows to be locked ?
Hib,positive,todo really bad evil hack to fix
Hib,positive,aliasrefnode resolve false false aliasrefnode gettext todo is it kosher to do it here ? todo is it kosher to do it here ?
Hib,positive,todo better to degrade to lazy false if uninstrumented
Hib,positive,does this dialect support the oracle style for update nowait syntax ?
Hib,positive,fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param props the configuration properties
Hib,positive,icky workaround for mysql bug
Hib,positive,we have to set up the table later yuck
Hib,positive,todo somehow add the newly created foreign keys to the internal collection
Hib,positive,this inner class implements a case statement perhaps im being a bit over clever here
Hib,positive,todo merge into one method
Hib,positive,todo this is a bit of copy paste from indexedcollection createprimarykey
Hib,positive,todo what type ?
Hib,positive,todo inefficient
Hib,positive,fixme get the persistentclass
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,todo this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
Hib,positive,todo redesign how propertyaccessors are acquired
Hib,positive,todo not so sure this is needed
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,create an index on the key columns ? ?
Hib,positive,todo joinkeycolumnname foreignkeycolumnname should be called either here or at a slightly higer level in the stack to get all the information we need right now hbmbinder does not support the
Hib,positive,todo improve this hack
Hib,positive,todo bad implementation cos it depends upon ordering of mapping doc fixing this requires that collection persistentclass gain access to the mappings reference from configuration or the filterdefinitions map directly sometime during configuration buildsessionfactory after all the types filter defs are known and before building persisters
Hib,positive,use of trim here is ugly ?
Hib,positive,todo ideally we need the construction of propertyaccessor to take the following entitymode entitymode specific data i e the classname for pojo entities property specific data based on the entitymode i e property name or dom j node name the easiest way with the introduction of the new runtime metamodel classes would be the the following predicates propertyaccessorfactory getpropertyaccessor takes references to both a org hibernate metadata entitymodemetadata and org hibernate metadata property what is now termed a propertyaccessor stores any values needed from those two pieces of information code can then simply call propertyaccess getgetter with no parameters likewise with propertyaccessor getsetter
Hib,positive,can happen because of the multiple ways cache remove can be invoked
Hib,positive,ick
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,todo this is very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since it does not take advantage of two phase load
Hib,positive,todo should this be session instantiate persister ?
Hib,positive,todo suck this into initlaziness
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive, hibernate temp use jdbc metadata defaults  is a temporary magic value the need for it is intended to be alleviated with future developement thus it is not defined as an environment constant it is used to control whether we should consult the jdbc metadata to determine certain settings default values it is useful to not do this when the database may not be available mainly in tools usage
Hib,positive,todo is this right ? ?
Hib,positive,ie the subquery yuck
Hib,positive,use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug
Hib,positive,todo copy paste from recreate
Hib,positive,workaround for backward compatibility of sets with no not null columns assume all columns are used in the row locator sql
Hib,positive,todo this eventually needs to be removed
Hib,positive,todo remove
Hib,positive,just to help out during the load ugly i know
Hib,positive,hack workaround as sqlquery impl depend on having a key
Hib,positive,todo handle the case of a foreign key to something other than the pk
Hib,positive,todo assumes all collections disassemble to an array
Hib,positive,todo would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity subclass would emit a notification which the extendsqueue entries could react to
Hib,positive,todo is it really neceassry to provide configuration to collectionpersisters ? should it not be enough with associated class ? or why does entitypersister is not get access to configuration ? the only reason i could see that configuration gets passed to collection persisters is so that they can look up the dom j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name was applied at the collection element level are you kidding me ? trivial to fix then just store and expose the node name on the entity persister which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means
Hib,positive,todo deprecated remove eventually
Hib,positive,todo possibly relax that
Hib,positive,todo this is a bit dodgy come up with a better way to check this plus see above comment
Hib,positive,use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility
Hib,positive,todo this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a property reference per se
Hib,positive,todo better to handle dynamic filters through implicit dynamicfilterparameterspecification see the discussion there in dynamicfilterparameterspecification is javadocs as to why it is currently not done that way
Hib,positive,get the right object from the list would it be easier to just call getentity ? ?
Hib,positive,todo should record how many properties we have reffered to and if we do not get em all we throw an exception way better than trial and error
Hib,positive,todo this dependency is kinda bad
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,why does this matter ?
Hib,positive,important to account for newly saved entities in query todo some kind of check for new status
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,todo can we always use the null property approach for everything ?
Hib,positive,does this need holdlock also ? return tablename with updlock rowlock holdlock
Hib,positive,for sets we should end the collection load after resolving the entities since we might call hashcode on the elements todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
Hib,positive,todo remove this and just have subclasses use isolater isolatedwork directly
Hib,positive,sql server at least needed this dropped after use strange
Hib,positive,is it necessary to register exact since it can only appear in a where clause ?
Hib,positive,for arrays we should end the collection load before resolving the entities since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
Hib,positive,does this dialect support the alter table syntax ?
Hib,positive,this next bit is to allow for both unsaved value negative and for older behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object todo shift it into unsaved value strategy
Hib,positive,todo reenable if we also fix the above todo
Hib,positive,orphans should not be deleted during copy ? ?
Hib,positive,orphans should not be deleted during merge ? ?
Hib,positive,todo suck this logic into the collection
Hib,positive,todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry s
Hib,positive,todo this bit actually has to be called after all cascades but since identity insert is called synchronously instead of asynchronously as other actions it is not
Hib,positive,this class has no proxies so do a shortcut
Hib,positive,todo should this be an initializeentityeventlistener ? ? ? watch out for performance
Hib,positive,todo need map ? the prob is a proper key right ?
Hib,positive,todo better to pass the id in as an argument ?
Hib,positive,do we even really need this ? the update will fail anyway
Hib,positive,todo would it be better to do a refresh from db ?
Hib,positive,this form used from annotations ? essentially the same as the above using a resultset mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment fixme annotations do not use it so it can be remove from my pov deprecated param query the sql query string param resultsetref the result set mapping name param queryspaces any specified query spaces used for auto flushing param cacheable whether the query results are cacheable param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the results param timeout a jdbc level timeout to be applied param fetchsize a jdbc level fetch size to be applied param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query param parametertypes parameter type map param callable does the query string represent a callable object i e proc
Hib,positive,todo ugly here
Hib,positive,todo not quite sure about the full implications of this
Hib,positive,this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set todo calling entryset on an identitymap is slow
Hib,positive,todo i  d much rather have this done from endloadingcollection collectionpersister loadingcollectionentry
Hib,positive,todo hack note here we cleanup the load context when we have no more local lce entries this works for the time being because really only the collection load contexts are implemented long term this cleanup should become part of the close result set processing from the sandbox jdbc jdbc container code
Hib,positive,todo add the notion of enabled filters to the cachekey to differentiate filtered collections from non filtered but cachekey is currently used for both collections and entities would ideally need to define two seperate ones currently this works in conjuction with the check on defaultinitializecollectioneventhandler initializecollectionfromcache which makes sure to not read from cache with enabled filters early exit
Hib,positive,postload is needed for ejb todo reuse the postloadevent
Hib,positive,todo should we check the current isolation mode explicitly ?
Hib,positive,brand new collection todo or an array we ca not lock objects with arrays now ? ?
Hib,positive,todo iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions transientcopycache size transientcopycache size is not decreasing and copycache size is not increasing todo find out if retrying can add entities to copycache do not think it can for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there are still any transient entities
Hib,positive,null or brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle arrays which have no snapshot so we ca not do any better
Hib,positive,todo perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved value ?
Hib,positive,provides query splitting methods which were originally in querytranslator br todo this will need to be refactored at some point author josh
Hib,positive,todo most of below was taken verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic or super type it
Hib,positive,todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy at some point we should expand this to support that capability however that has some difficulties the biggest is how to handle ors when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins here we would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the fromelement so it can pass it along to the joinsequence
Hib,positive,no explicit select expression render the id and properties projection lists for every persister in the from clause into a single  token node  todo the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filters we should get rid of derived select clause completely
Hib,positive,todo better way ? ?
Hib,positive,hack alert attempt to work around ghost impliedfromelements that occasionally show up between the actual things being joined this consistently occurs from index nodes at least against many to many not sure if there are other conditions essentially look ahead to the next fromelement that actually writes something to the sql
Hib,positive,not possible to simply re use the versionpropertynode here as it causes oom errors due to circularity
Hib,positive,this function has a template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast to avoid using an interface ? yuck
Hib,positive,at some point the generate phase needs to be moved out of here because a single object level dml might spawn multiple sql dml command executions possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates queryloader statementexecutor themselves also not sure why queryloader currently even has a dependency on this at all does it need it ? ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegates directly
Hib,positive,todo this is only needed during compilation can we eliminate the instvar ?
Hib,positive,todo absolutely no usages of this constructor form can it go away ?
Hib,positive,todo is this a bit ugly ?
Hib,positive,even here if only properties mapped to the base table are referenced in the set and where clauses this could be handled by the basicdelegate todo decide if it is better performance wise to perform that check or to simply use the multitableupdatedelegate
Hib,positive,todo remove these last two as batcher is no longer managing connections
Hib,positive,very important this class needs to be free of any static references to any cglib or javassist classes otherwise users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which if either they use another option here would be to remove the hibernate ispropertyinitialized method and have the users go through the sessionfactory to get this information
Hib,positive,todo we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hql sql grammar expects all those node types to be fromreferencenodes one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclause fromelement combo as a child of the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement that is probably the easiest approach read least amount of changes to the grammar and code but just does not feel right as then an insert would contain from clauses
Hib,positive,todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters the table info gotten here should really be self contained i e a class representation defining all the needed attributes then we could then get an array of those
Hib,positive,todo switch statements are always evil we already had bugs because of forgotten token types use polymorphism for this
Hib,positive,really there are two situations where it should be ok to allow the insertion into properties defined on a superclass union subclass with an abstract root entity discrim subclass is handled already because of the fact that unionsubclasspersister alreay always returns for this call we may want to disallow it for discrim subclass just for consistency sake currently does not work anyway
Hib,positive,implicit joins are always ? ok to reuse
Hib,positive,todo used to be exprnoparens was this needed ?
Hib,positive,todo we may also want to check that the types here map to exactly one column jdbc type ca not think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi column mappings makes any sense
Hib,positive,we do not know either type blind guess
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of here create an ast for the join expressions use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression
Hib,positive,we would probably refactor to have logicparser builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not expressionparser translates from oo terms like foo foo bar foo bar baz to sql terms like foos id foos bar id etc and pathexpressionparser which does much the same thing it does now
Hib,positive,short circuit for performance
Hib,positive,not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release
Hib,positive,try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name this allows the we assume custom interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityname
Hib,positive,todo this is one of the ugliest and most fragile pieces of code in hibernate
Hib,positive,todo implement functionality this might be painful to do here as the join post processing for the subquery has already been performed meaning that for theta join dialects the join conditions have already been moved over to the where clause a simple solution here might to perform join post processing once for the entire query including any subqueries at one fell swoop
Hib,positive,yuck
Hib,positive,ignore it the incoming property could not be found so we cannot be sure what to do here at the very least the safest is to simply not apply any dereference toggling
Hib,positive,todo make this a bit nicer
Hib,positive,yuck
Hib,positive,todo potentially look at optimizing these two arrays
Hib,positive,note that i parameter is now unused delete it ?
Hib,positive,todo figure out a better way to get the from elements in a proper tree structure if this is not the destination of a many to many add it as a child of the origin
Hib,positive,todo this constructor form is only used from constructor directly below us can it go away ?
Hib,positive,todo remove
Hib,positive,we should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to processing a stream of tokens we instead build up a tree of expressions
Hib,positive,todo should this get moved to persistentcontext ? logically is persistentcontext the thing to which an interceptor gets attached ?
Hib,positive,todo something much better look at the type of the other expression todo have comparisonexpression and or arithmeticexpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes
Hib,positive,todo this class does too many things we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent ways in which path expressions can occur
Hib,positive,todo optimize this better
Hib,positive,todo should we allow suffixes on these ?
Hib,positive,todo is this really necessary ? ? ? ?
Hib,positive,todo not sure the best way to handle this the non performant way
Hib,positive,todo is there a better way ?
Hib,positive,the class is now way to complex
Hib,positive,todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query def so as to not have to re calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset ref stuff
Hib,positive,name from a super query a bit inelegant that it shows up here
Hib,positive,real hacky used to count the nesting of parentheses
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,put has nowait semantics is this really appropriate ? note that it needs to be async replication never local or sync
Hib,positive,ugly hack for cases like elements foo bar collection multi part path expression ending in elements or indices
Hib,positive,fixme hacky workaround to jbcache
Hib,positive,todo copy paste from sessionimpl pull up
Hib,positive,todo need to find a clean way to handle the event source role a seperate classs responsible for generating dispatching events just duplicates most of the session methods passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext is not manageable
Hib,positive,must be done here because of side effect yuck
Hib,positive,we should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way
Hib,positive,todo should remove this exposure and have all references to the session is batcher use the connectionmanager
Hib,positive,we may be screwed here since the collection action is about to execute and we do not know the final owner key value
Hib,positive,needed the clazz check to work around union subclasses todo is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim column based inheritence ?
Hib,positive,work around a bug in all known connection pools
Hib,positive,todo reuse the preloadevent
Hib,positive,need a better way to define the suffixes here
Hib,positive,workaround for weblogic
Hib,positive,todo temporary
Hib,positive,todo yuck fix after hhh is complete
Hib,positive,would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff would need to change the way the max row stuff is handled i e behind an interface so that i could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
Hib,positive,todo the i entityspan bit depends upon subclass implementation very bad
Hib,positive,some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take an aliased path or a path rooted at the creating criteria instance
Hib,positive,todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package
Hib,positive,polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps well actually its ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here which it will be
Hib,positive,this is not very nice and quite slow
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of here
Hib,positive,meant to handle dynamic instantiation queries copy from queryloader
Hib,positive,make sure this is a defined parameter and check the incoming value type todo what should be the actual exception type here ?
Hib,positive,worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here
Hib,positive,todo throw exception ? maybe warn if not the same ?
Hib,positive,todo make entitypersister not depend on sessionfactoryimplementor interface if possible
Hib,positive,todo what amount of significant digits need to be supported here ? from the decimalformat docs significant digits minimum integer digits maximum fraction digits
Hib,positive,for backward compatibility allow a set with no not null element columns using all columns in the row locater sql todo create an implicit not null constraint on all cols ?
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,todo copy paste from manytoonetype
Hib,positive,todo code duplication with singletableentitypersister
Hib,positive,todo throw exception ?
Hib,positive,should this interface extend propertymapping ?
Hib,positive,todo here is why we need to make bytecode provider global todo again fix this after hhh is complete
Hib,positive,todo currently keeps getters and setters instead of propertyaccessors because of the way getgetter and getsetter are implemented currently yuck
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,todo yuck this is not quite good enough it is a quick hack around the problem of having a to one association that refers to an embedded component
Hib,positive,todo implement caching ? proxies ?
Hib,positive,is this really necessary ?
Hib,positive,todo this is a little inefficient do not need to do a whole deep replaceelements call
Hib,positive,todo this is a bit arbitrary expose a switch to the user ?
Hib,positive,return collection removal fixme even if isinverse true ?
Hib,positive,todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
Hib,positive,todo move these to a new joinabletype abstract class extended by entitytype and persistentcollectiontype
Hib,positive,todo would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly
Hib,positive,spaces todo i m not sure but perhaps we should exclude abstract denormalized tables ?
Hib,positive,todo is there a more elegant way than downcasting ?
Hib,positive,todo remove
Hib,positive,todo remove use of instanceof
Hib,positive,create an index on the key columns ? ?
Hib,positive,todo make this a bit nicer
Hib,positive,todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
Hib,positive,todo perhaps this should be some other runtimeexception
Hib,positive,yuck
Hib,positive,todo need some caching scheme ? really comes down to decision regarding amount of state if any kept on propertyaccessors
Hib,positive,todo this eventually needs to be removed
Hib,positive,todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory
Hib,positive,todo we should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here
Hib,positive,todo should this really return null ? if not figure out something better to do here
Hib,positive,todo should seriously consider not allowing a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session
Hib,positive,should indicate that we are processing an insert update delete query with a subquery implied via a collection property function here we need to use the table name itself as the qualification alias todo verify this works for all databases todo is this also the case in non indexed scenarios ?
Hib,positive,todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
Hib,positive,todo make this the factory for entity mode related sessions also means making this the target of transaction synch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions at that point perhaps this thing is a sessioncontext and connectionmanager is a jdbccontext ? a sessioncontext should live in the impl package
Hib,positive,create an index on the key columns ? ?
Hib,positive,is this ok ?
Hib,positive,init the table here instead of earlier so that we can get a quoted table name todo would it be better to simply pass the qualified table name instead of splitting it up into schema catalog table names
Hib,positive,perhaps this should be an exception since it is only ever used in the above method ?
Hib,positive,note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass was tounqotedaliasstrings getdiscriminatorcolumnname before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases
Hib,positive,put a placeholder in entries so we do not recurse back and try to save the same object again question should this be done before onsave is called ? likewise should it be done before onupdate ?
Hib,positive,before cascade todo should this be session instantiate persister ?
Hib,positive,todo we should throw an exception if we really know for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new staleobjectstateexception entityname id
Hib,positive,todo the order in which entities are saved may matter e g a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entities can be saved keep retrying the batch of transient entities until either there are no transient entities left in transientcopycache or no transient entities were saved in the last batch for now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge
Hib,positive,todo if object was an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two sql selects
Hib,positive,todo put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second level cache needs some extra work
Hib,positive,todo not quite sure about the full implications of this
Hib,positive,this is kinda the best we can do
Hib,positive,trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cant handle whitespaces before a in a sp
Hib,positive,todo this need not exclude subclasses
Hib,positive,todo we use two visitors here inefficient
Hib,positive,trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cant handle whitespaces before a in a sp
Hib,positive,todo does this really need to be here ? does the collection already have it is own up to date snapshot ?
Hib,positive,otherwise a trim specification and or a trim character have been specified we need to decide which options are present and do the right thing should leading trim characters be trimmed ? should trailing trim characters be trimmed ? the trim character the trim source
Hib,positive,it is possible that the tree walking in outerjoinloader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known this temporary solution assumes that the property ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to a reasonable guess todo fix this add outerjoinloadable getsubclasspropertytablename string propertyname
Hib,positive,todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then return collection getowner
Hib,positive,i suppose ?
Hib,positive,tbd should this be varbinary ? registercolumntype types varbinary binary
Hib,positive,shortcut
Hib,positive,todo we should provide some way to get keys of collection of statistics to make it easier to retrieve from a gui perspective
Hib,positive,todo probably better to calculate these and pass them in as it will be more performant
Hib,positive,todo should we additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly ?
Hib,positive,todo simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,todo is there really any reason to kkeep trying if this fails once ?
Hib,positive,todo not sure this is correct could not find docs on how to do this
Hib,positive,hsql has no blob clob support but just put these here for now
Hib,positive,merges do not cascade to uninitialized collections todo perhaps this does need to cascade after all
Hib,positive,yick need this for proper serialization deserialization handling
Hib,positive,todo should orphans really be deleted during lock ? ? ?
Hib,positive,todo move to stringhelper ?
Hib,positive,sets can be just a view of a part of another collection do we need to copy it to be sure it wo not be changing underneath us ? ie this set addall set
Hib,positive,todo it would be really really nice to use this to also model components
Hib,positive,todo move to sql package
Hib,positive,todo look at the owning property and check that it is not lazy by instrumentation
Hib,positive,todo add this info to the translator and aggregate it here
Hib,positive,todo possibly relax that
Hib,positive,todo possibly relax that
Hib,positive,would be better to use the element type to determine whether the old and the new are equal here the problem being we do not necessarily have access to the element type in all cases
Hib,positive,todo code duplication with joinedsubclassentitypersister
Hib,positive,todo refactor to sql package
Hib,positive,todo two hashmap lookups here is one too many
Hib,positive,note that this method could easily be moved up to basicentitypersister if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
Hib,positive,from the collection of associations locate oja for the manytoone corresponding to this persister to fully define the many to many we need that oja so that we can use its alias here todo is there a better way here ?
Hib,positive,todo this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package add a criteriaimplementor interface
Hib,positive,do we need to qualify index names with the schema name ?
Hib,positive,todo we probably should have a statisticsnotpublishedexception to make it clean
Hib,positive,todo get sql rendering out of this package
Hib,positive,yukky do not you have subclasses for that todo race conditions can happen here
Hib,positive,note very hackish workaround todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
Hib,positive,todo need to make the majority of this functionality into a top level support class for custom impl support
Hib,positive,for dom j collections only todo it would be better if this was done at the higher level by printer
Hib,positive,todo inefficient if that cache is just going to ignore the updated state
Hib,positive,todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then get the id from collection getowner
Hib,positive,todo refactor make this method private
Hib,positive,todo keep seperate notions of qt here for shallow non shallow queries
Hib,positive,todo temporary needed because currently persister is the one that creates and renders the join fragments for inheritence hierarchies
Hib,positive,this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call stop
Hib,positive,swaldman modify to allow null values to signify fall through to c p poolconfig defaults
Hib,positive,work around that crazy issue where the tree contains empty fromelements no text afaict this is caused by fromelementfactory createcollectionjoin
Hib,positive,kinda ugly but needed for collections with a node mapping
Hib,positive,fixme get the persistentclass
Hib,positive,todo would be great to have a mapping hasnonidentifierpropertynamedid method i do not believe that mapping getreferencedpropertytype accounts for the identifier property so if it returns for a property named  id  then we should have a non id field named id
Hib,positive,entity name will not be available for non pojo entities todo cache the entity name somewhere so that it is available to this exception
Hib,positive,todo is this really necessary ? ? ? ?
Hib,positive,index getpropertycolumnspan i todo this is kinda slow
Hib,positive,todo move to sql package and refactor with similar things
Hib,positive,todo i am not so sure about the exception handling in this bit
Hib,positive,ugly little workaround for fact that createuniquekeyloaders does not handle component properties
Hib,positive,append the sql to return the generated identifier todo suck into insert
Hib,positive,this is really ugly but necessary
Hib,positive,todo modify the class definition if not already transformed
Hib,positive,todo should we use select for update ?
Hib,positive,create an action that will evict collection and entity regions based on queryspaces table names todo cache the autodetected information and pass it in instead
Hib,positive,todo is this correct ?
Hib,positive,used only for regression testing todo obviously get rid of all this junk
Hib,positive,note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass was tounqotedaliasstrings getidentifercolumnnames before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases
Hib,positive,use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug
Hib,positive,todo move into collection type so we can use polymorphism
Hib,positive,todo should we just collect these like with the collections above ?
Hib,positive,todo should really move this log statement to collectiontype where this is used from
Hib,positive,fixme hacky workaround to jbcache
Hib,positive,hum should we cascade anyway ? throw an exception ? fine like it is ?
Hib,positive,todo this might really even be moved into the cfg package and used as the basis for all things which are configurable
Hib,positive,todo copy paste from insertrows
Hib,positive,todo suck into event class
Hib,positive,todo never reached since gettypename actually throws an exception
Hib,positive,this is used by sessionfactoryimpl to hand to the generated sessionimpl was the only reason i could see that we cannot just use null as settings cacheprovider
Hib,positive,xmlforest requires a new kind of function constructor
Hib,positive,todo is this a valid operation on a timestamps cache ?
Hib,positive,todo i considered validating the presence of the ts cache here but decided to defer unti getquerycacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
Hib,positive,todo why not use the timestamp in a dataversion ?
Hib,positive,todo eventually merge this with treecache and just add optional opt lock support there
Hib,positive,fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param props the configuration properties
Hib,positive,fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param props the configuration properties
Hib,positive,work around the feature where tree cache is validating the inserted node during the next transaction no idea
Hib,positive,fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param props the configuration properties
Hib,positive,todo i considered validating ts cache config here but decided to defer unti gettimestampscacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
Hib,positive,can happen because of the multiple ways cache remove can be invoked
Hib,positive,need to do that here rather than in the save event listener to let the post insert events to have a id filled entity when identity is used ejb
Hib,positive,unhappy about this being public is there a better way ?
Hib,positive,todo safe to interpret map remove key null as non dirty ?
Hib,positive,fixme hack to work around fact that calling node added root addchild fqn does not properly set the version on the node
Hib,positive,work around the feature where tree cache is validating the inserted node during the next transaction no idea
Hib,positive,todo is this a valid operation on a timestamps cache ?
Hib,positive,todo what else to do here ?
Hib,positive,todo replace this with a more elegant solution
Hib,positive,short cut check
Hib,positive,todo to handle concurrent writes correctly this should return a lock to the client
Hib,positive,put has nowait semantics is this really appropriate ? note that it needs to be async replication never local or sync
Hib,positive,this is ugly here but needed because its a subquery
Hib,positive,todo will need reference to session factory to fully complete hhh
Hib,positive,yuck
Hib,positive,inheritance cycle detection paranoid check
Hib,positive,todo remove
Hib,positive,todo encapsulate the protected instance variables
Hib,positive,polymorphism comment above
Hib,positive,todo find a decent name before documenting
Hib,positive,add an entry for this type of entity we can be assured that all referenced entities have already been processed so specify that this entity is with the latest batch doing the batch number before adding the name to the list is a faster way to get an accurate number
Hib,positive,todo handle typedefs
Hib,positive,todo get all properties not just the fetched ones
Hib,positive,todo native ids
Hib,positive,todo bindpropertyresults alias returnelem
Hib,positive,todo handle property ref
Hib,positive,todo validate existing of property with the chosen name secondpass
Hib,positive,todo get all properties not just the fetched ones
Hib,positive,todo check that entry getidentifier equals requestedid
Hib,positive,todo restrict violation
Hib,positive,todo assertion only could be optimized away
Hib,positive,todo lowercasing done here was done at random before maybe not needed at all ?
Hib,positive,todo optimize away this lookup for entities w o unsaved value undefined
Hib,positive,todo tolowercase was not done before only used in template
Hib,positive,todo arithmetic expressions multiple new foo
Hib,positive,todo check that entry getidentifier equals requestedid
Hib,positive,todo not visible to the user
Hib,positive,todo proxies
Hib,positive,todo can we limit stored procedures ?
Hib,positive,todo formulas ?
Hib,positive,todo better error message since we actually support composites if names are explicitly listed
Hib,positive,todo use these in methods above
Hib,positive,todo cache the persister this shows up in yourkit
Hib,positive,todo add referencedclass to disambiguate to fks on the same columns pointing to different tables
Hib,positive,todo create uk loaders for component properties
Hib,positive,todo still need to make collectionpersisters entitymode aware
Hib,positive,todo terrible implementation
Hib,positive,todo eventually put this back in once we think all is fixed object otheralias columnsunique put qualifiedcolumn columnalias
Hib,positive,todo i do not really like this implementation it would be better if this was handled by searchfordirtycollections
Hib,positive,todo check if key contains the owner id
Hib,positive,todo cache this in an instvar
Hib,positive,todo temporary initial step towards hhh
Hib,positive,todo remove this once componentmetamodel is complete and merged
Hib,positive,todo add owner argument
Hib,positive,todo handle supportsnotnullunique false but such a case does not exist in the wild so far
Hib,positive,todo better error message since we actually support composites if names are explicitly listed
Hib,positive,todo for some dialects it would be appropriate to add the renderorderbypropertiesselect to other select strings
Hib,positive,todo unnecessary for databases with ansi style joins
Hib,positive,todo maybe call it getrowselection ?
Hib,positive,todo make this handle multiple collection roles
Hib,positive,todo include the rowids
Hib,positive,if we are still not resolved we might represent a constant needed to add this here because the allowance of naked prop refs in the grammar collides with the definition of literals constants nondeterminism todo cleanup the grammar so that processconstants is always just handled from here
Hib,positive,todo or should we return  containstablealias  ? ?
Hib,positive,todo look at perhaps caching this
Hib,positive,todo avoid this for non new instances where mightbedirty false
Hib,positive,todo theoretically non threadsafe
Hib,positive,todo look at optimizing these
Hib,positive,todo cache this sql
Hib,positive,todo check if mimer sql cannot handle the way db does
Hib,positive,todo if we are using identity columns fetch the identifier
Hib,positive,todo check there is no actual definition elemnents when a ref is defined
Hib,positive,table null an association fill it in later todo fill in the mappings for table null
Hib,positive,table null an association fill it in later todo fill in the mappings for table null
Hib,positive,todo add support for read write nonstrict read write ? ? ?
Hib,positive,todo return new lock ts
Hib,positive,todo add support for read write nonstrict read write ? ? ?
Hib,positive,todo why are not these the same ?
Hib,positive,todo proxies
Hib,positive,todo proxies
Hib,positive,todo if we support multiple fetch groups we would need to clone the set of lazy properties
Hib,positive,todo mappings getlogicaltablename ownertable
Hib,positive,todo if lock gettimestamp equals ts
Hib,positive,todo always true for now but not if we later decide to support elements in the from clause
Hib,positive,we could move this inside if we wanted to tolerate collection initializations during collection dirty checking
Hib,negative,see if the user configured a multiplexer stack
Hib,negative,root entity comes last
Hib,negative,elementtype ? ?
Hib,negative,scan the query string for class names appearing in the from clause and replace with all persistent implementors of the class interface returning multiple query strings make sure we do not pick up a class in the select clause
Hib,negative,identifier collections not supported for to many
Hib,negative,potentialtrimcharacterargindex assumes that a trim specification has been specified we handle the exception to that explicitly
Hib,negative,overridden informational metadata
Hib,negative,if the current depth is the root thing being loaded is the many to many collection itself here it is alright to use an inner join
Hib,negative,update removed rows fks to null
Hib,negative,registerfunction trim new standardsqlfunction trim hibernate string
Hib,negative,buf append selectfragment lhsalias ignore suffix for collection columns
Hib,negative,initialize the set of queried identifier spaces ie tables
Hib,negative,use suffix for the entity columns
Hib,negative,we got here because we assumed that an instance with an assigned id was detached when it was really persistent
Hib,negative,the class hierarchy structure
Hib,negative,remove the current element from insertions it will be added back later
Hib,negative,private final string roottablename
Hib,negative,note this is being used from the process of shutting down a sessionfactory specific things to consider this clearing of the region should not propagate to other nodes on the cluster if any this is the cache mode local option bit really just trying a best effort to cleanup after ourselves lock failures etc are not critical here this is the fail silently option bit
Hib,negative,initialization
Hib,negative,stuff that is persister centric and or entityinfo centric
Hib,negative,not null start with is implicit
Hib,negative,continue loop
Hib,negative,return existing object or initialized proxy unless deleted
Hib,negative,the list of entity names that indicate the batch number
Hib,negative,disassembled state gets put in a new array we write to cache by value
Hib,negative,add these directly to the executions queue
Hib,negative,execute the sql
Hib,negative,sort the updates by fk
Hib,negative,this could also just be true all the time
Hib,negative,the mapping of entity names to their latest batch numbers
Hib,negative,chop the last union all
Hib,negative,note that for sequential scrolling we make the assumption that the first persister element is the root entity
Hib,negative,todo check this
Hib,negative,for deprecated saveorupdatecopy
Hib,negative,initialization
Hib,negative, check constraint violation unique index or primary key violation
Hib,negative,the closure of all properties in the entire hierarchy including subclasses and superclasses of this class
Hib,negative,expressionterminators add deliberately excluded
Hib,negative,subclass discrimination works by assigning particular values to certain combinations of null primary key values in the outer join using an sql case
Hib,negative,tokens that close a sub expression tokens that open a sub expression tokens that would indicate a sub expression is a boolean expression
Hib,negative,multi param numeric dialect functions
Hib,negative,use theta style for regression move the node up after the origin node
Hib,negative,multi param date dialect functions
Hib,negative,overridden informational metadata
Hib,negative,add the main query
Hib,negative,sqlexception support
Hib,negative,add the restriction to the outer select
Hib,negative,bit length feels a bit broken to me we have to cast to char in order to pass when a numeric value is supplied but of course the answers given will be wildly different for these two datatypes will be bytes as a char string but will be or bytes as a true numeric jay nance
Hib,negative,this assumes you will want to ignore any update counts
Hib,negative,skip the from keyword in params
Hib,negative,custom sql
Hib,negative,return a newly loaded object
Hib,negative,make it circular reference safe
Hib,negative,cope with special cases of and not
Hib,negative,subclass closure properties
Hib,negative,for dialects which are known to not support ansi sql row value constructor syntax we should mutate the tree
Hib,negative,overridden informational metadata
Hib,negative,we have the form trim from trimsource this is functionally equivalent to trim trimsource early exit
Hib,negative,subclasses
Hib,negative,need to hydrate it
Hib,negative,starts with implicitly
Hib,negative,instantiate a new instance
Hib,negative,simple nullability constraint
Hib,negative,we need to upgrade the lock mode to the mode requested
Hib,negative,register the type of the out param an oracle specific type
Hib,negative,look for a proxy
Hib,negative,features which change between i i and g
Hib,negative,evicts do not cascade to uninitialized collections
Hib,negative,features which remain constant across i i and g
Hib,negative,need to treat this as if it where optimistic lock all dirty does not make sense first we need to locate the loaded state note it potentially could be a proxy so perform the location the safe way
Hib,negative,column sc gettable getprimarykey getcolumniterator next getname
Hib,negative,might happen with a managed connection
Hib,negative,do not need subclass tables because they ca not appear in conditions
Hib,negative,not final static to avoid possible classcast exceptions if using different oracle drivers
Hib,negative,make certain that this is called before any subsequent scheduledupdate aftertransactioncompletion
Hib,negative,private list aliases new arraylist
Hib,negative,the reason for this is sql does not let you sort by an expression you are not returning in the result set
Hib,negative,register resolvers set via environment property
Hib,negative,an existing collection that was either non empty or uninitialized is replaced by null or a different collection if the collection is uninitialized hibernate has no way of knowing if the collection is actually empty without querying the db
Hib,negative,update all the modified entries
Hib,negative,special case where we need to force incloude all subclass joins
Hib,negative,we did not find a collection element in the result set so we ensure that a collection is created with the owner is identifier since what we have is an empty collection
Hib,negative,binary stream character stream
Hib,negative,ignore it
Hib,negative,getdefaultproperties setproperty environment statement batch size no batch
Hib,negative,assumes that types are all of span
Hib,negative,hibernate impelemnts cast in dialect java
Hib,negative,this is the root versioned table and we are using version based optimistic locking if we are not updating the version also do not check it unless this is a generated version column
Hib,negative,aggregate functions should not be registered right ? registerfunction list new standardsqlfunction list hibernate string stopped on list
Hib,negative,its the given optional object
Hib,negative,the class hierarchy structure
Hib,negative,decide which resultset to get the property value from
Hib,negative,properties of this class including inherited properties
Hib,negative,otherwise assume the parent is the the criteria that created us
Hib,negative,the closure of all columns used by the entire hierarchy including subclasses and superclasses of this class
Hib,negative,we can go straight to the first required row
Hib,negative,now look up the object we are really interested in this lets us correctly handle proxies and multi row or multi column queries
Hib,negative,before adding to collection
Hib,negative,discriminator column
Hib,negative,code to handle subclasses of topclass
Hib,negative,initialization
Hib,negative,none because its the requested lock mode not the actual
Hib,negative,private final map propertytablenumbersbyname new hashmap
Hib,negative,conceivable that the dialect ctor could throw hibernateexceptions so do not re wrap
Hib,negative,class table
Hib,negative,synchronized to avoid multi thread access issues defined as method synch to avoid potential deadlock issues due to nature of code
Hib,negative,required to exception table iconst i
Hib,negative,for now just re flatten the metamodel since this is temporary stuff anyway hhh
Hib,negative,checkcast cast the bean into a raw bean
Hib,negative,this one only really needed for badly behaved applications if the transactionmanager has a sychronization registered its a noop actually we do need it for downgrading locks
Hib,negative,checkcast case of primitive type invokevirtual case of primitive type
Hib,negative,at this point we have drivingsqlalias the sql alias of the driving table corresponding to the given user alias however the driving table is not necessarily the table against which we want to apply locks mainly the exception case here is joined subclass hierarchies where we instead want to apply the lock against the root table for all other strategies it just happens that driving and root are the same
Hib,negative,this bean args i raw bean exception
Hib,negative,get the first child to be considered sub classes may do this differently in order to skip nodes that are not select expressions e g distinct

Hib,negative,we really could refresh the item if it is not a lock but it might be slower return freshtimestamp txtimestamp
Hib,negative,due to the complexity in initializing the selectclause do not generate one here if it is not found simply return null also do not cache since it gets generated well after we are created
Hib,negative,discriminator
Hib,negative,versiontype impl note simply returns null for seed and next as the only known application of binary types for versioning is for use with the timestamp datatype supported by sybase and sql server which are completely db generated values

Hib,negative,again ccs did not have such a concept but a reasonable proximity is to clear the cache after transaction as long as the underlying cache is not jta aware
Hib,negative,oracle driver reports to support getgeneratedkeys but they only support the version taking an array of the names of the columns to be returned via its returning clause no other driver seems to support this overloaded version
Hib,negative,again ccs did not have such a concept however a reasonable proximity is to clear the cache for non transaction aware caches we will also do a clear at the end of the transaction

Hib,negative,the name of the sql function that transforms a string to lowercase
Hib,negative,null owner ok ? ?
Hib,negative,essentially if the real session is closed allow any method call to pass through since the real session will complain by throwing an appropriate exception note that allowing close above has the same basic effect but we capture that there simply to perform the unbind
Hib,negative,automatically makes a column with the default name if none is specifed by xml

Hib,negative,we should use the current object state ie after any updates that occurred during flush
Hib,negative,might need to run a different filter entirely after the flush because the collection role may have changed

Hib,negative,ca not cache this stuff either per invocation we are given a map of user alias lock mode create a new map of sql alias lock mode
Hib,negative,note dirtyfields null means we had no snapshot and we could not get one using select before update oldfields null just means we had no snapshot to begin with we might have used select before update to get the dirtyfields

Hib,negative,or should it actually throw an exception ?
Hib,negative,both many to one and one to one are represented as a property entitypersister is relying on this value to determine lazy fetch groups in terms of field level interception so we need to make sure that we return true here for the case of many to one and one to one with lazy no proxy impl note lazy no proxy currently forces both lazy and unwrap to be set to true the other case we are extremely interested in here is that of lazy proxy where lazy is set to true but unwrap is set to false thus we use both here under the assumption that this return is really only ever used during persister construction to determine the lazy property field fetch groupings if that assertion changes then this check needs to change as well partially this is an issue with the overloading of the term lazy here

Hib,negative,note that each iteration of the loop may add new elements
Hib,negative,if we know there is exactly row we can skip it would be great if we could always skip this it is a problem for key many to one
Hib,negative,this can never happen because this rule will always eliminate the child not case not return x getfirstchild not not x x
Hib,negative,we need to obtain the lock before any actions are executed since this may be an inverse true bidirectional association and it is one of the earlier entity actions which actually updates the database this action is resposible for second level cache invalidation only

Hib,negative,this has been shown to happen occasionally in rare cases when using a transaction manager transaction timeout where the timeout calls back through hibernate is registered transaction synchronization on a separate reaping thread in cases where that reaping thread executes through this block at the same time the main application thread does we can get into situations where these cmes occur and though it is not allowed per se the end result without handling it specifically is infinite looping so here we simply break the loop

Hib,negative,reset the version
Hib,negative,note this simply constructs a raw sql token representing the where fragment and injects this into the tree this works however it is probably not the best long term solution at some point we probably want to apply an additional grammar to properly tokenize this where fragment into constituent parts focused on the operators embedded within the fragment
Hib,negative,the default is to simply not lazy fetch properties for now
Hib,negative,aliases for identifier alias id skip if the entity defines a non id property named  id
Hib,negative,else if it is elements changed
Hib,negative,this assumes you will want to ignore any update counts
Hib,negative,attributes maintained between flush cycles
Hib,negative,now rebuild the insertions list there is a batch for each entry in the name list
Hib,negative,should be safe to only ever expect entitypersister references here
Hib,negative,if the original is a persistentcollection and that original was not flagged as dirty then reset the target is dirty flag here after the copy operation p one thing to be careful of here is a bare original collection in which case we should never ever ever reset the dirty flag on the target because we simply do not know

Hib,negative,note this affects the return value
Hib,negative,istransactioncallbackregistered denotes whether any hibernate transaction has registered as a callback against this jdbccontext only one such callback is allowed directly serializing this value causes problems with jdbctransaction or really any transaction impl where the callback is local to the transaction instance itself since that transaction is not serialized along with the jdbccontext thus we handle that fact here explicitly
Hib,negative,note evict operates locally only i e does not propogate to any other nodes in the potential cluster this is exactly what is needed when we destroy here destroy is used as part of the process of shutting down a sessionfactory thus these removals should not be propogated

Hib,negative,if the from element represents a join fragment and it is a theta style join convert its type from join fragment to from fragment
Hib,negative,check basic level one nullablilty
Hib,negative,add a zero or quite low timeout option so we do not block ignore any timeoutexception basically we forego caching the query result in order to avoid blocking reads are done with suspended tx so they should not hold the lock for long not caching the query result is ok since any subsequent read will just see the old result with its out of date timestamp that result will be discarded and the db query performed again
Hib,negative,values is not null and is checkable we will look deeper
Hib,negative,possibly handle something parameters for the query ?
Hib,negative,for non null args check for components and elements containing components
Hib,negative,if we want to handle it bidirectional and detached we also need to load this collection with an eager outer join fetch this time with criteria and not hql
Hib,negative,cache the hashcode
Hib,negative,public propertyprojection project return projections property getpropertyname
Hib,negative,persistent collections may have components
Hib,negative,we have the jbcwritemutex so no other local thread will be trying to write this key it is possible here some remote thread has come in and changed the values again but since we are reading the values to write to jbc right now we know we are writing the latest values i e we do not assume that what we cached in entry update above is what we should write to jbc now our write could be redundant i e we are writing what some remote thread just came in an wrote there is a chance that yet another remote thread will update us and we will then overwrite that later data in jbc but all remote nodes will ignore that change in their localcache the only place it will live will be in jbc where it can only effect the initial state transfer values on newly joined nodes i e populatelocalcache
Hib,negative,test out the optimizer
Hib,negative,registercolumntype types varchar mediumtext
Hib,negative,ident might be the name of a class
Hib,negative,here we do not want to suspend the tx if we do we might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes no tx no wl on cache node so other threads can prematurely see those query results no tx immediate replication more overhead plus we spread issue above around the cluster
Hib,negative,todo
Hib,negative,for regression testing against output from the old parser found it easiest to simply reorder the fromelements here into ascending order in terms of injecting them into the resulting sql ast in orders relative to those expected by the old parser this is definitely another of those only needed for regression purposes the syntheticandfactory then simply injects them as it encounters them

Hib,negative,fetch reader content up to the end and put characters in a stringbuffer
Hib,negative,the loop ensures atomicity of the select update even for no transaction or read committed isolation level
Hib,negative,return stringbuffer content as a large string
Hib,negative,the where clause was added to eliminate this statement from brute force searches

Hib,negative,we ignore minimalputoverride jbosscache putforexternalread is already about as minimal as we can get it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
Hib,negative,forcefully remove leading ands from where fragments the grammar will handle adding them
Hib,negative,for non arrays we do not need to know the element class elementtype returnedclass
Hib,negative,chop off the rest of the tree
Hib,negative,grab its state from the resultset and keep it in the session but do not yet initialize the object itself note that we acquire lockmode read even if it was not requested
Hib,negative,different nullability rules for pk fk
Hib,negative,if the types report logical equivalence return true
Hib,negative,cache this
Hib,negative,for a subquery the alias to use depends on a few things we already know this is not an overall select if this from element represents a correlation to the outer most query a if the outer query represents a multi table persister we need to use the given alias in anticipation of one of the multi table executors being used as this subquery will actually be used in the id select phase of that multi table executor b otherwise we need to use the persister is table name as the column qualification otherwise not correlated use the given alias
Hib,negative,only really need new array during semiresolve
Hib,negative,classic translator does not support collection of ordinal param metadata
Hib,negative,unwrap it
Hib,negative,cache the hashcode
Hib,negative,an unfetched association can only point to an entity that already exists in the db
Hib,negative,here we work under the following assumptions valid cases datetime something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions datetime datetime always results in a double datetime something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions invalid cases datetime datetime something other than datetime datetime datetime any type datetime any type any type datetime doing so allows us to properly handle parameters as either the left or right side here in the majority of cases

Hib,negative,eq a null is null a
Hib,negative,the path ast should be a dotnode and it should have been evaluated already
Hib,negative,force a substitution
Hib,negative,if if otherwise handle the error normally
Hib,negative,the database now holds a lock the object is flushed from the cache so release the soft lock
Hib,negative,now update the object has to be outside the main if block above because of collections
Hib,negative,named queries
Hib,negative,this is a situation where the entity id is assigned by a post insert generator and was saved outside the transaction forcing it to be delayed
Hib,negative,grab its state saved at deletion
Hib,negative,grab its current state
Hib,negative,this will throw an error if there is something wrong
Hib,negative,collection deletions are a special case since update can add deletions of collections not loaded by the session
Hib,negative,if the natural id is marked as non mutable it is not retrieved during a normal database snapshot operation
Hib,negative,watch out for a case where old is still referenced somewhere in the object graph which is a user error
Hib,negative,slice to get the columns for this component property
Hib,negative,schedule the update note that we intentionally do not pass in currentpersistentstate
Hib,negative,substitutes into values by side effect
Hib,negative,give the interceptor a chance to process property values if the properties were modified by the interceptor we need to set them back to the object
Hib,negative,not eq a b ne a b
Hib,negative,compare to cached state ignoring collections unless versioned
Hib,negative,if it was dirtied by a collection only
Hib,negative,check nullability but do not perform command execute we will use scheduled updates for that
Hib,negative,this  dot  expression now refers to the resulting from element
Hib,negative,not like a b not like a b
Hib,negative,the collectionentry isreached stuff is just to detect any silly users who set up circular or shared references between to collections
Hib,negative,detached collection wrappers that get found reattached during flush should not be ignored
Hib,negative,not is not null a b is null a b
Hib,negative,the unique property value represented here may or may not be serializable so we do an explicit check here in order to generate a better error message
Hib,negative,if the version of a newly instantiated object is not the same as the version seed value use that as the unsaved value
Hib,negative,ie we never have to null out a reference to an uninitialized proxy
Hib,negative,not not like a b like a b
Hib,negative,give the interceptor a chance to modify property values
Hib,negative,now we might need to recalculate the dirtyproperties array

Hib,negative,this implementation is supposed to tolerate incorrect unsaved value mappings for the purpose of backward compatibility
Hib,negative,wrap up any new collections directly referenced by the object or its components
Hib,negative,skip this check for composite ids relating to dom j entity mode alternatively we could add a check to make sure the incoming id value is an instance of element
Hib,negative,upgrade the lock if necessary lock result lockmode
Hib,negative,now any collections that are initialized inside this block do not get updated they are ignored until the next flush
Hib,negative,not ne a b eq a b
Hib,negative,we must clone embedded composite identifiers or we will get back the same instance that we pass in
Hib,negative,sub insertions should occur before containing insertion so try to do the callback now
Hib,negative,not le a b gt a b
Hib,negative,not ge a b lt a b
Hib,negative,not lt a b ge a b
Hib,negative,the entity is not associated with the session so try interceptor and unsaved value
Hib,negative,and the expected token type was an identifier then
Hib,negative,igndore it
Hib,negative,jsd the fix for hhh
Hib,negative,if the token can tell us if it could be an identifier

Hib,negative,some filters affecting the collection are enabled on the session so do not do the put into the cache
Hib,negative,generate an explicit join for the root dot node the implied joins will be collected and passed up to the root dot node
Hib,negative,a session is considered to contain an entity only if the entity has an entry in the session is persistence context and the entry reports that the entity has not been removed
Hib,negative,and the token could be an identifer and the error is a mismatched token error
Hib,negative,if a where clause was specified in the update delete query use it to limit the returned ids here
Hib,negative,default implementation if this node has a data type and that data type is not an association then this is scalar
Hib,negative,resolve the lhs fully generate implicit joins pass in the property name so that the resolver can discover foreign key id properties
Hib,negative,if the propertytype is null and there is not a parent just stop now there was a problem resolving the node anyway
Hib,negative,we do not look for an existing join on the same path because it makes sense to join twice on the same collection role
Hib,negative,return new uninitialized proxy
Hib,negative,this object was already loaded
Hib,negative,entity was found in second level cache
Hib,negative,intializes result by side effect

Hib,negative,transform the tree
Hib,negative,parse the query string into an hql ast
Hib,negative,we do not actually propogate antlrexceptions as a cause so log it here for diagnostic purposes
Hib,negative,so this needs to be safe from concurrent modification problems it is safe because of how identitymap implements entryset
Hib,negative,only needed during compilation phase
Hib,negative,update the status of the object and if necessary schedule an update
Hib,negative,schedule updates to collections
Hib,negative,we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity inserts updates in order to account for bidi associations
Hib,negative,the database has changed now so the subselect results need to be invalidated
Hib,negative,if the collection is dereferenced remove from the session cache iter remove does not work since the entryset is not backed by the set
Hib,negative,phase parse the hql into an ast

Hib,negative,ensures that containing deletions happen before sub deletions
Hib,negative,cascade delete to collections before the collection owner is deleted
Hib,negative,cascade delete to many to one after the parent was deleted
Hib,negative,if it is an initialized proxy let cascade handle it later on
Hib,negative,assign the requested id to the proxy before reassociating the proxy
Hib,negative,an uninitialized proxy noop do not even need to return an id since it is never a save
Hib,negative,initialize properties of the event
Hib,negative,return the id in the event object

Hib,negative,continue we will find out if it ends up not getting saved later
Hib,negative,cascade first so that all unsaved objects get their copy created before we actually copy
Hib,negative,check that entity id requestedid
Hib,negative,not a collection ? return the entity property mapping
Hib,negative,collection of many to any mappings used to circumvent the component collection check below
Hib,negative,otherwise the destination node was implied by the from clause and the from clause processor will automatically add it in the right place
Hib,negative,if the first identifier in the path referrs to the class alias not the class name then this is a correlated subselect if it is a correlated sub select use the existing table alias otherwise generate a new one
Hib,negative,this uses a pathexpressionparser but notice that compound paths are not valid only bare names and simple paths
Hib,negative,origin adddestination destination add the query spaces
Hib,negative,reset the node type because the rest of the system is expecting from fragment all we wanted was for the factory to create the right sub class this might get reset again later on anyway to make the sql generation simpler
Hib,negative,explicit true this is an explict select arraylist sqlresulttypelist new arraylist
Hib,negative,sqlresulttypelist add type generate the select expression
Hib,negative,if the expression list has exactly one expression and the type of the expression is a collection then this might be a collection function such as index c or size c
Hib,negative,the uber rule here is that we need to include subclass joins if the fromelement is in any way dereferenced by a property from the subclass table otherwise we end up with column references qualified by a non existent table reference in the resulting sql
Hib,negative,before cascade
Hib,negative,cascade first so that all unsaved objects get their copy created before we actually copy
Hib,negative,copyvalues works by reflection so explicitly mark the entity instance dirty
Hib,negative,the following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression in the list of nested subexpressions we are currently processing
Hib,negative,no need to even collect this information if the persister is considered multi table
Hib,negative,as soon as we encounter our first letter return the substring from that position
Hib,negative,retrieve the value of the designated column in the current row of this resultset object as a java io reader object
Hib,negative,for arrays replaceelements may return a different reference since the array length might not match
Hib,negative,should not be able to reach last without maxposition being set unless there are no results
Hib,negative,do not use proxiesbykey since not all proxies that point to this session is instances are in that collection
Hib,negative,this should be a call to resolve not resolveidentifier  cos it might be a property ref and we did not cache the referenced value
Hib,negative,if we have tt not found ignore tt association mapped to a formula we always need to dirty check it so we can update the second level cache
Hib,negative,we now have the value of the property ref we reference however we need to dig a little deeper as that property might also be an entity type in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
Hib,negative,true if this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role otherwise this is a collectioninitializer and we are loading up a single collection or batch
Hib,negative,persister
Hib,negative,this method should be implemented assuming it is valid to do start stop start leave state appropriate for another start
Hib,negative,we do not want to waste effort setting an option if jbc is already in local mode if jbc is repl a sync then check if they passed an config option to disable query replication
Hib,negative,see if we had a nd invalidation from the same initial preinvalidation timestamp if so only increment if the new current value is an increase
Hib,negative,if the workspace node has null as well ok if not we  ve been modified in a non comparable manner which we have to treat as us being newer
Hib,negative,maintain correct duplication if loaded in a cartesian product
Hib,negative,local cache so we use synchronization
Hib,negative,datasource unpooled datasources unpooleddatasource jdbcurl props getproperty environment user props getproperty environment pass
Hib,negative,do not need to lock the cache here since if someone else inserted the same pk first the insert would fail
Hib,negative,we need to grab the version value from the entity otherwise we have issues with generated version entities that may have multiple actions queued during the same flush
Hib,negative,short circuit s no new elements the old list contains only orphans no old elements so no orphans neither
Hib,negative,test out the optimizer
Hib,negative,get the updated snapshot of the entity state by cloning current state it is safe to copy in place since by this time no one else should have has a reference to the array
Hib,negative,persister iscacheinvalidationrequired
Hib,negative,long
Hib,negative,set the existing pool flag to true
Hib,negative,validate that an alias name was provided to determine which pool to use
Hib,negative,we have created the pool ourselves so shut it down
Hib,negative,the load which takes an entity does not pass an entityname
Hib,negative,note expected in the syntax type listenerclass sep type listenerclass where sep is any whitespace or comma
Hib,negative,tree cache in optimistic mode seems to have as very difficult time with remove calls on non existent nodes npes
Hib,negative,we ignore minimalputoverride jbosscache putforexternalread is already about as minimal as we can get it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
Hib,negative,it does not refer to an alias of a projection look for a property
Hib,negative,do nothing for persistent instances
Hib,negative,optimisticcache impl
Hib,negative,option setdataversion nonlockingdataversion instance
Hib,negative,assume true since we do not really know and it does not matter
Hib,negative,show the modified ast
Hib,negative,note firstrow is zero based
Hib,negative,initialize dirty flags for arrays collections with composite elements and reset reached doupdate etc
Hib,negative,use the delegate
Hib,negative,use the delegate
Hib,negative,tell the dot node about the join type
Hib,negative,this  dot  expression now refers to the resulting from element
Hib,negative,among other things updatereachables will recursively load all collections that are moving roles this might cause entities to be loaded
Hib,negative,post flushing section
Hib,negative,otherwise recreate the mapping between the collection and its key
Hib,negative,create a parameter specification for the collection filter
Hib,negative,attach any mapping defined order by fragments
Hib,negative,we found some extends attributes referencing entities which were not already processed here we need to locate all entity names and class names contained in this document itself making sure that these get removed from the extendz list such that only extends names which require us to delay processing i e external to this document and not yet processed are contained in the returned result
Hib,negative,make sure that the persister is versioned
Hib,negative,for native sql queries the param metadata is determined outside any relation to a query plan because query plan creation and or retreival for a native sql query depends on all of the return types having been set which might not be the case up front when param metadata would be most useful
Hib,negative,this function has a template redirect output and catch the arguments
Hib,negative,use the id assigned to the instance
Hib,negative,if no array holder we found an unwrappered array this ca not occur because we now always call wrap before getting to here return ah null ? true searchfordirtycollections ah type
Hib,negative,a collection loaded in the current session can not possibly be the collection belonging to the entity passed to update
Hib,negative,if the data type is not an association type it could not have been in the from clause
Hib,negative,we need to generate ids as part of this bulk insert note that this is only supported for sequence style generators and post insert style generators basically only in db generators
Hib,negative,first look for a reference to a projection alias
Hib,negative,first look for a reference to a projection alias
Hib,negative,handle trace logging
Hib,negative,if there are no collection fetches then no further checks are needed
Hib,negative,commented out by inspection am int getwarningcount
Hib,negative,if a threadlocalsessioncontext bound session happens to get serialized to be completely correct we need to make sure that unbinding of that session occurs
Hib,negative,make sure no alias is applied to the table name
Hib,negative,delegate to the queryloader
Hib,negative,switch
Hib,negative,we do not actually propogate antlrexceptions as a cause so log it here for diagnostic purposes
Hib,negative,use the explicitly declared select expression determine the return types indicated by each select token
Hib,negative,select clauses for insert statements should alwasy be treated as shallow
Hib,negative,after that process the joins invoke a delegate to do the work as this is farily complex
Hib,negative,cache impl
Hib,negative,simple cache of param metadata based on query string ideally the original user supplied query string should be used to retreive this metadata i e not the para list expanded query string to avoid unnecessary cache entries used solely for caching param metadata for native sql queries see getsqlparametermetadata for a discussion as to why
Hib,negative,use the delegate
Hib,negative,alias references and identifiers use the same node class
Hib,negative,make a new one
Hib,negative,
Hib,negative,these are just two unrelated table references
Hib,negative,again both should be fromelements
Hib,negative,check a set of parent child nodes in the from clause tree to determine if a comma is required between them
Hib,negative,phase analyze the hql ast and produce an sql ast
Hib,negative,phase generate the sql
Hib,negative,otherwise we have a non scalar select with defined collection fetch es make sure that there is only a single root entity in the return no tuples
Hib,negative,paramtranslations new parametertranslationsimpl collectedparameterspecifications
Hib,negative,we are already processing a dot structure
Hib,negative,should mean that no such property was found
Hib,negative,initialize the error handling delegate
Hib,negative,was there an explicit select expression ?
Hib,negative,resolve everything up to this dot but do not resolve the placeholders yet
Hib,negative,not not between a b between a b
Hib,negative,just add a  not  parent
Hib,negative,first save off the pertinent ids as the return value
Hib,negative,check to see if the connection is in auto commit mode no connection means aggressive connection release outside a jta transaction context so must be autocommit mode
Hib,negative,first save off the pertinent ids saving the number of pertinent ids for return
Hib,negative,start performing the deletes
Hib,negative,do not forget to resolve the argument resolve the collection function now
Hib,negative,otherwise everything ok
Hib,negative,re arrange the tree so that the collection function is the root and the lhs is the path
Hib,negative,protected regionrootlistener listener
Hib,negative,inject the where after the parent
Hib,negative,never include subclasses for implied from elements
Hib,negative,establish the region root node with a non locking data version
Hib,negative,for pessimistic locking we just want to toss out our ref to any old invalid root node and get the latest may be null
Hib,negative,the rest only matters for optimistic locking where we need to establish the proper data version on the region root
Hib,negative,prepare the left hand side and get the data type
Hib,negative,prepare the left hand side and get the data type
Hib,negative,if this dot has already been resolved stop now
Hib,negative,properties
Hib,negative,the property is another class
Hib,negative,otherwise this is a primitive type
Hib,negative,foo bars size also handles deprecated stuff like foo bars maxelement for backwardness
Hib,negative,use the delegate
Hib,negative,for timestamps we default to a separate config
Hib,negative,optimistic lock all include all updatable properties optimistic lock dirty include all properties we are updating this time
Hib,negative,this property belongs to the table and it is not specifically excluded from optimistic locking by optimistic lock false
Hib,negative,information about properties of this class including inherited properties only really needed for updatable insertable properties
Hib,negative,here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated for partial component generation we currently just re select the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions
Hib,negative,note addduplicatealias already performs nullness checks on the alias
Hib,negative,if the from clauses are the same we can be a little more aggressive in terms of what we reuse
Hib,negative,aload
Hib,negative,again null null here
Hib,negative,otherwise subquery case dont reuse the fromelement if we are processing the from clause of the subquery
Hib,negative,we know only the lhs hand type so use that
Hib,negative,the referenced node text is the special  id
Hib,negative,only the identifier property field name can be a reference to the associated entity is pk
Hib,negative,special shortcut for id properties skip the join this must only occur at the end of a path expression
Hib,negative,append the new property name onto the unresolved path
Hib,negative,tell the destination fromelement to  includesubclasses
Hib,negative,if the lhs is a collection use collectionpropertymapping
Hib,negative,do not resolve the node again
Hib,negative,lists arrays sets maps bags
Hib,negative,we have something like ? op rhs
Hib,negative,configure the cache to use our tm
Hib,negative,make sure jbc does not look one up
Hib,negative,we finish all the removes first to take care of possible unique constraints and so that we can take better advantage of batching
Hib,negative,use a combination of foreign key columns and pk columns since the ordering of removal and addition is not guaranteed when a child moves from one parent to another
Hib,negative,make sure we do not re release the same cache
Hib,negative,we use a different delegate than the non optimistic superclass default
Hib,negative,we have something like lhs op ?
Hib,negative,do not create a unique key  cos some databases do not like a uk on nullable columns getcollectiontable createuniquekey getidentifier getconstraintcolumns
Hib,negative,isset collection isset issorted collection issorted
Hib,negative,we know only the rhs hand type so use that
Hib,negative,if jbc is using invalidation we do not want to propagate changes we use the timestamps cache to manage invalidation
Hib,negative,long
Hib,negative,do not hold the jbc node lock throughout the tx as that prevents updates add a zero or low timeout option so we do not block waiting for tx is that did a put to commit
Hib,negative,double check the distributed cache
Hib,negative,get an exclusive right to update jbc for this key from this node
Hib,negative,one or the other needs to be a datetime for us to get into this method in the first place
Hib,negative,
Hib,negative,nothing to do
Hib,negative,add the condition to the join sequence that qualifies the indexed element
Hib,negative,sometimes use the element table alias sometimes use the umm collection table alias many to many
Hib,negative,now set the text for this node it should be the element columns
Hib,negative,get the function return value type based on the type of the first argument
Hib,negative,this will call initialize tok
Hib,negative,mutation depends on the types of nodes invloved
Hib,negative,logic operators by definition resolve to booleans
Hib,negative,generated select expressions are already resolved nothing to do
Hib,negative,the path may be a reference to an alias defined in the parent query
Hib,negative,the hql class alias refers to the class name
Hib,negative,associate the table alias with the element
Hib,negative,try the parent fromclause
Hib,negative,make sure that all from elements registered with this from clause are actually in the ast
Hib,negative,invoke setscalarcolumntext on each constructor argument
Hib,negative,collect the select expressions skip the first child because it is the class name
Hib,negative,return an empty type array
Hib,negative,we ensure async semantics jbcache
Hib,negative,if there is no order by make one
Hib,negative,initial load from jbc
Hib,negative,find the where if there is no where find the from
Hib,negative,now inject the newly built order by into the tree
Hib,negative,logic operators by definition resolve to boolean
Hib,negative,render the identifier select fragment using the table alias
Hib,negative,class names in the from clause result in a joinsequence the old fromparser does this
Hib,negative,will still be issued when it used to be null
Hib,negative,otherwise use the property mapping
Hib,negative,we ensure async semantics jbcache
Hib,negative,the standard comparator types are not serializable but are singletons
Hib,negative,ignore
Hib,negative,ignore it
Hib,negative,generate implicit joins only if necessary
Hib,negative,if the property is a special collection property name return a collectionpropertymapping
Hib,negative,collection of components
Hib,negative,construct the cache
Hib,negative,local cache so we use synchronization
Hib,negative,ie seconds
Hib,negative,we need to seed the version value as part of this bulk insert
Hib,negative,make sure the lhs is assignable
Hib,negative,false indicates to not generate parens around the assignment
Hib,negative,currently allowed
Hib,negative,in non select queries the only time we should need to join is if we are in a subquery from clause
Hib,negative,return classalias null ? classname classalias
Hib,negative,this is an explicit from element
Hib,negative,swaldman define c p style configuration parameters for initialpoolsize which hibernate sensibly lets default to minpoolsize but we will let users override it with the c p style property if they want
Hib,negative,parametercontainer impl
Hib,negative,fetch ca not be used with scroll or iterate
Hib,negative,if it is not implied or it is implied and it is a many to many join where the target was not found
Hib,negative,we need to wrtap the param in a cast
Hib,negative,since this is an explicit from element it ca not be implied in the from clause
Hib,negative,do nothing eplicit from elements are always in the projection list
Hib,negative,propertyname refers to something like collection size
Hib,negative,property name is a sub path of a component
Hib,negative,always add the collection is query spaces
Hib,negative,nothing to do even if the operand is a parameter no way we could infer an appropriate expected type here
Hib,negative,notify the from element that it is being referenced by the select
Hib,negative,logic operators by definition resolve to booleans
Hib,negative,dotnode uses null here
Hib,negative,we represent a from clause alias
Hib,negative,we are the rhs of the dot representing a naked comp prop ref
Hib,negative,we represent a naked simple prop ref
Hib,negative,early exit return so the resolve call explicitly coming from dotnode can resolve this
Hib,negative,assume this ident is text does not refer to a property on the given persister
Hib,negative,just ignore it for now it will get resolved later
Hib,negative,this is not actually a constant but a reference to from element
Hib,negative,check to see if our proppath actually represents a property on the persister
Hib,negative,these pieces are needed for usage in select clause
Hib,negative,assume we do not refer to a property on the given persister
Hib,negative,true if the pool is borrowed from the outside false if we used to create it
Hib,negative,assume we do not refer to a property on the given persister
Hib,negative,get a connection from the pool thru drivermanager cfr proxool doc
Hib,negative,set the transaction isolation if defined
Hib,negative,naked property refs cannot be used with an aliased from element
Hib,negative,do not over write the column text as that has already been rendered during resolve
Hib,negative,look up class name using the first identifier in the path
Hib,negative,toggle autocommit to false if set
Hib,negative,add to the query spaces
Hib,negative,return the connection
Hib,negative,if the from element is not in the same clause create a new from element
Hib,negative,correlated subqueries create ispecial  implied from nodes because correlated subselects ca not use an ansi style join

JEd,positive,technically incorrect here we need to wrap null values as bsh primitive null however the this invokemethod will do that much for us we need to generate a conditional here to test for null and return primitive null
JEd,positive,looks bad with the os x l f apparently
JEd,positive,very subtle if we leave this for ensurephysicallineisvisible an extra line will be added to the scroll line count
JEd,positive,only works for jedit plugins

JEd,positive,broken class
JEd,positive,while its broken to have a null symlinkpath some older plugins might
JEd,positive,this is not good need a way to update eval without re installing so that we can re eval params etc when classloader changes look into this
JEd,positive,this seems to make nested readlock calls work okay but i have no idea if it actually fixes things or not
JEd,positive,but if hypersearch results window is floating the workaround causes problems
JEd,positive,set the buffer is path caveat wo not work if save called with a relative path but i do not think anyone calls it like that anyway

JEd,positive,looks bad with the os x l f apparently
JEd,positive,apparently in some environments you ca not catch the security exception at all e g as an applet in ie will probably have to work around
JEd,positive,if it exists remove it and add it at the end avoid memory leak
JEd,positive,race condition here
JEd,positive,use special cheats that speed up the code currently about but may cause problems with future maintenance and add to the class file size about bytes
JEd,positive,if it exists remove it and add it at the end avoid memory leak
JEd,positive,original note jdk under win is throwing these to warn about lower case upper case possible mismatch e g bsh console bsh console update prior to we were squeltching noclassdeffounderrors which was very annoying i cannot reproduce the original problem and this was never a valid solution if there are legacy vms that have problems we can include a more specific test for them here

JEd,positive,this class is not very fast
JEd,positive,note this method incorrectly caches the method structure it needs to be cleared when the classloader changes
JEd,positive,xxx action bar might not be  temp
JEd,positive,i wonder if the lack of this broke anything in the past ?
JEd,positive,implement string value according to the jls value may be anything in beanshell we will disallow void undefined values or should we map them to the empty string ?
JEd,positive,this should be before dockables are initialized
JEd,positive,is this right ?
JEd,positive,should we do this for both cases above ?
JEd,positive,need to loosen this to any throwable do we need to handle that in interpreter somewhere ? check first
JEd,positive,fucking gtk look and feel
JEd,positive,note this implementation is temporary we currently keep a flat namespace of the base name of classes i e beanshell cannot be in the process of defining two classes in different packages with the same base name to remove this limitation requires that we work through namespace imports in an analogous or using the same path as regular class import resolution this workaround should handle most cases so we will try it for now
JEd,positive,copy and paste from bsh classpath classmanagerimpl java
JEd,positive,i wish i could make this friendly to only namespace
JEd,positive,undocumented hack to allow browser actions to work xxx clean up in
JEd,positive,look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicates that in namespace getcommand is that ok ?
JEd,positive,this should be per instance
JEd,positive,can we use the proxy mechanism to cast a bsh this to the correct interface ?
JEd,positive,redundant with constructor
JEd,positive,issues to resolve here in which classloader should we define the class ? if there is a bshclassloader should we define it there ? should we use reflection to set it in a non bsh classloader if there is one or should we always create a bsh classloader and expose its defineclass ?
JEd,positive,could refactor these a bit
JEd,positive,note this class essentially just delegates most of its methods to its parent the setvariable indirection is very small we could probably fold this functionality back into the base namespace as a special case but this has changed a few times so i  d like to leave this abstraction for now
JEd,positive,simplified these settings a little
JEd,positive,should check for strict java here and use isjavaassignable instead
JEd,positive,workaround for swing rendering labels starting with html using the html engine
JEd,positive,look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicates that in this java should it ? call on  this  can never be a command
JEd,positive,this method is a nightmare
JEd,positive,consoleinterface the interpreter reflexively implements the console interface that it uses should clean this up by using an inner class to implement the console for us
JEd,positive,case insensitive fs workaround
JEd,positive,wrap nulls this is a bit of a cludge to address a deficiency in the class generator whereby it does not wrap nulls on method delegate see class generator java if we fix that then we can remove this just have to generate the code there
JEd,positive,switch eats a multi level break here ? not empty statement
JEd,positive,check for field on object note could eliminate throwing the exception somehow
JEd,positive,xxxx re evaluate this can getsuper work by itself now ? if we  re a class instance and the parent is also a class instance then super means our parent
JEd,positive,i wish protected access were limited to children and not also package scope i want this to be a singleton implemented by various children
JEd,positive,imported full name was not found as an absolute class if it is compound try to resolve to an inner class maybe this should happen in the bshclassmanager ?
JEd,positive,ca not this be combined with run ? run seems to have stuff in it for interactive vs non interactive compare them side by side and see what they do differently aside from the exception handling
JEd,positive,copy and paste from bsh classpath classmanagerimpl java
JEd,positive,null value is just a declaration note we might want to keep any existing value here instead of reset
JEd,positive,can this be factored out ? should be be adding the l here instead ?
JEd,positive,catch the mismatch and continue to try the next note this is innefficient should have an isassignablefrom that does not throw
JEd,positive,should use try finally here to pop ns
JEd,positive,note this could be made clearer by adding an inner class for the cases and an object context for the child traversal
JEd,positive,hack sticking to first interpreter that resolves this see comments on type instance variable
JEd,positive,note incorrect here we are using the hack in bsh class manager that allows lookup by base name we need to eliminate this limitation by working through imports see notes in class manager
JEd,positive,this is the namespace in which the method is set it is a back reference for the node which needs to execute under this namespace it is not necessary to declare this transient because we can only be saved as part of our namespace anyway currently
JEd,positive,replace this is cocoa api calls later
JEd,positive,scripting classes currently requires accessibility this can be eliminated with a bit more work
JEd,positive,this could be static
JEd,positive,thanks to slava pestov of jedit fame for import caching enhancements note this class has gotten too big it should be broken down a bit
JEd,positive,register an attribute declaration for later retrieval format string type string default value int value type todo do something with attribute types
JEd,positive,todo to get cast and boxing working e g e g byte ia if the basetype is a wrapper type then we need to get the primitive type class for the base type here in order for the cast to allow it then boxing will happen naturally in the array set e g integer ia
JEd,positive,note we will ll move this behavior out to a subclass of namespace but we will start here
JEd,positive,this is a particularly nasty bit of code that checks for a parameter entity reference but peeks ahead to catch the in parameter entity declarations
JEd,positive,should cache this subject to classloader change message evaluation of the formal parameter simply resolves its type via the specified namespace it does not modify the namespace
JEd,positive,notes it would not be hard to eliminate the use of org objectweb asm type from this class making the distribution a tiny bit smaller
JEd,positive,fucking gtk look and feel
JEd,positive,stupid caret will automatically be incremented
JEd,positive,spacing workaround
JEd,positive,i do not know of any other way to fix this since invoking this command from a menu results in the focus owner being the menu until the menu goes away
JEd,positive,a little hack for reverse replace and find
JEd,positive,static methods that operate on compound separated names i guess we could move these to stringutil someday
JEd,positive,note which of these things should be checked at parse time vs run time ?
JEd,positive,this part sucks
JEd,positive,windows bug workaround in case a yes no confirm was shown
JEd,positive,clear name resolvers do not know if this is necessary
JEd,positive,this is stupid and misleading but  path  is not used anywhere except the above line and if this is done after the  continue  then we will either hang or be forced to duplicate it inside the buffer null or add a  finally  clause you decide which one is worse
JEd,positive,i m too tired to think of a better way to handle this right now
JEd,positive,hacked bufferiorequest to send vfsupdates in case two stage save is off now
JEd,positive,some other primitive should avoid calling methods on primitive as we do in name ca not treat primitive like an object message but the hole is useful right now
JEd,positive,change the parent which was the class static to the class instance we really need to check if we  re a static inner class here first but for some reason java wo not show the static modifier on our fake inner classes could generate a flag field
JEd,positive,this is where checked exceptions piss me off this method only uses a stringreader which can never throw an exception
JEd,positive,if any subexpressions did not terminate they do not count todo check if this code ever gets hit
JEd,positive,parse pattern into tokens does anyone know if it is more efficient to use char than a string charat ? i m assuming so
JEd,positive,note object is only used here for precondition get rid of it ?
JEd,positive,why both of these ?
JEd,positive,cut off from parent we must have our own class manager ca not do this in the run command needs to resolve stuff should we do it by default when we create a namespace will no parent of class manager ?
JEd,positive,note the bsh command code should probably not be here we need to scope it by the namespace that imported the command so it probably needs to be integrated into namespace
JEd,positive,this could be smarter
JEd,positive,it was explicitly imported but we do not know what it is should we throw an error here ? ?
JEd,positive,note we need a form of eval that passes the callstack through
JEd,positive,primary interpreter set and get variable methods note these are squeltching errors should they ?
JEd,positive,workaround for jdk bug where system in available returns too large a value this bug has been fixed in jdk
JEd,positive,somewhat of a hack if the special fields are visible we  re operating relative to a  this  type already dissallow further this references to prevent user from skipping to things like super this caller
JEd,positive,should clean this up to a single return statement
JEd,positive,implementation notes note we may need some synchronization in here note on version dependency this base class is jdk compatible however we are forced to use weak references in the full featured implementation the optional bsh classpath package to accomodate all of the fleeting namespace listeners as they fall out of scope namespaces must be informed if the class space changes so that they can un cache names p perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached types always perform a light weight check with a counter reference value and use that to detect changes in the namespace this puts the burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times but could eliminate the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak references in this package p
JEd,positive,note this impor pattern is becoming common could factor it out into an importedobject vector class
JEd,positive,not sure if we should really recurse here for explicitly imported class in parent
JEd,positive,the following two boolean checks were tacked on this could probably be smoothed out
JEd,positive,notes this is broken it finds public but less specific methods over non public but more specific ones findmostspecficmethod needs to be rewritten to eliminate findaccessiblemethod we should implement the findmostspecificmethod that uses the publiconly flag findmostspecificmethod should also operate in two passes to give standard java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches
JEd,positive,unixworkaround constructor
JEd,positive,drag and drop support i  d just move the code to jedittextarea but it depends on jdk apis
JEd,positive,next version remove this
JEd,positive,compatibility kludge for jedit and earlier
JEd,positive,stupid scrollbar policy is an attempt to work around bugs people have been seeing with ibm is jdk sep
JEd,positive,this is a weird hack we do not want c e a to insert  a  in the search bar if the search bar has focus
JEd,positive,aha this is probably the only way to fix this
JEd,positive,this is a dirty hack and it relies on the fact that updates for parents are sent before updates for the changed nodes themselves if this was not the case the browser would not be updated properly on delete etc to avoid causing   request  errors do not reload directory if request already active
JEd,positive,we consume this to work around the bug where a tab window switching activates the menu bar on windows
JEd,positive,i guess translated events do not have the  evt  field set so consuming wo not work i do not think this is a problem as nothing uses translation anyway
JEd,positive,this is a hack and really needs to be done better
JEd,positive,copy and paste from resyntaxmatcher to make syntax package independent of jedit itself
JEd,positive,stupidity
JEd,positive,this does not seem very correct but it fixes a problem when setting the initial caret position for a buffer eg from the recent file list
JEd,positive,do not try this at home
JEd,positive,silly that we reference the vertical scroll bar here directly we do this so that the horizontal scroll bar is flush with the vertical scroll bar
JEd,positive,xxx clean up this conditional
JEd,positive,temporary hack to support inner classes if the obj is a non static inner class then import the context this is not a sufficient emulation of inner classes replace this later
JEd,positive,workaround for swing is annoying processing of labels starting with html which often breaks
JEd,positive,fucking gtk look and feel
JEd,positive,hack so that iselect all  does not change current buffer
JEd,positive,if an occurence occurs at the beginning of the selection the selection start will get moved this sucks so we hack to avoid it
JEd,positive,silly bug workaround if you look at the above code note that we restore the saved caret position first then scroll to the saved location however the caret changing can itself result in scrolling to a different location than what was saved and since movecaretposition calls updatebrackethighlight the bracket highlight is out of bounds calculation will rely on a different set of physical first last lines than what we will end up with eventually instead of confusing the user with status messages that appear at random when switching buffers we simply hide the message altogether
JEd,positive,this is a sloppy hack to fix bug hitting return after collapsed fold the idea is that if we extend the range then the problem described in the bug happends so if the insert is at the very end of the range we do not extend it instead we push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly we also have to mess with screen line counts
JEd,positive,need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack to work
JEd,positive,xxx if we keep the createclassmanager in getclassmanager then we can axe this ?
JEd,positive,note this class is messy the method and field resolution need to be rewritten various methods in here catch nosuchmethod or nosuchfield exceptions during their searches these should be rewritten to avoid having to catch the exceptions method lookups are now cached at a high level so they are less important however the logic is messy
JEd,positive,the sooner ppl move to the new api the less we will need crap like this
JEd,positive,nasty hardcoded values
JEd,positive,strip off drive letters review would a better check be file separator ?
JEd,positive,xxx magic number
JEd,positive,workaround for uncooperative windows l f
JEd,positive,have to do this hack until vfspath class is written
JEd,positive,stupid swing
JEd,positive,none of the others are ever meant to be removed retarded eh ? this needs to be fixed eventually for plugins might want to do weird stuff to jedit is ui
JEd,positive,this is retarded excuse me while i drool and make stupid noises
JEd,positive,stupid scrollbar policy is an attempt to work around bugs people have been seeing with ibm is jdk sep
JEd,positive,retarded gtk look and feel
JEd,positive,should probably error
JEd,positive,there must be a better way of fixing this the problem is that this method can sometimes be called as a result of a text area scroll event in which case the caret position has not been updated yet
JEd,positive,perhaps here we would want to guard with a property for parallel backups or not
JEd,positive,this is such a bad way of doing it but oh well
JEd,positive,while this might be questionable some menus depend on properties
JEd,positive,get available screens o n this is nasty but since we are not dealling with many items it should be fine
JEd,positive,methods that really should not be public
JEd,positive,unixworkaround class
JEd,positive,perhaps if xerces was not slightly brain damaged we would not need this
JEd,positive,this is a weird hack we do not want c e a to insert  a  in the search bar if the search bar has focus
JEd,positive,moved to guiutilities as it makes no sense being here
JEd,positive,hack need a more direct way of obtaining a view ? jedittextarea getview method ?

JEd,positive,move me to classpath classmanagerimpl ? ? ?
JEd,positive,they never taught you this in undergrad computer science
JEd,positive,should we cache info in not a class case too ?
JEd,positive,wtf ?
JEd,positive,xxx hairy code that is basically just a functional ? port of some other code i barely understood
JEd,positive,first try for an accessible version of the exact match this first lookup seems redundant with below but is apparently needed this whole thing is messy

JEd,positive,this feels sloppy especially for non u s locales
JEd,positive,hack to get fixed length  length  field
JEd,positive,we have to deal with assembly the programmer can be writing little byte chunks for all we know and we must assemble complete records for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer ? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying
JEd,positive,hack done to fix bringing the window to the front at least on windows frame tofront does not cut it remove the iswindows check if it is broken under other oses too
JEd,positive,this method should be rewritten to use getfields and avoid catching exceptions during the search
JEd,positive,hack
JEd,positive,this is such a bad way of doing it but oh well
JEd,positive,xxx magic number
JEd,positive,this should probably be in reflect java
JEd,positive,notes see notes on findmostspecificmethod this method should be rolled into findmostspecificmethod
JEd,positive,note is using signaturekey in this way dangerous ? in the pathological case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of argument types to an untyped method maybe we could be smarter about it by ignoring the types of untyped parameter positions ? the method resolver could return a set of hints for the signature key caching ? there is also the overhead of creating one of these for every method dispatched what is the alternative ?
JEd,positive,crusty workaround
JEd,positive,workaround for a keys producing garbage on windows
JEd,positive,addtofavorites which is a static method for convinience needs an instance of the vfs to pass to vfsmanager sendvfsupdate hence this hack
JEd,positive,allow getthis to work through blocknamespace to the method namespace xxx re eval this do we need it ?
JEd,positive,this part sucks
JEd,positive,these are used to eliminate code duplication i do not normally use the visitor or template method pattern but this code was contributed by peter cox and i do not feel like changing it around too much
JEd,positive,switch eats a multi level break here ? not empty statement
JEd,positive,this part sucks
JEd,positive,fuck me dead
JEd,positive,stupid hack to handle referencing a rule set that is defined later
JEd,positive,jdk workaround
JEd,positive,fuck me dead
JEd,positive,should the next two be public maybe ?
JEd,positive,stupidity
JEd,positive,note this method and resolveexpectedjavafield should be rewritten to invert this logic so that no exceptions need to be caught unecessarily this is just a temporary impl return the field or null if not found
JEd,positive,note we need a singleton here so that things like  this this  work and probably a good idea for speed caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the declaringinterpreter could be different under some circumstances case a child interpreter running a source eval command however the effect is just that the main interpreter that executes your script should be the one involved in call backs from java i do not know if there are corner cases where a child interpreter would be the first to use a this reference in a namespace or if that would even cause any problems if it did we could do some experiments to find out and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter basis if we had weak references we might also look at skipping over child interpreters and going to the parent for the declaring interpreter so we  d be sure to get the top interpreter
JEd,positive,resolve relative to a class type static field inner class ?
JEd,positive,some regexps eg by itself have a length so we implement this hack if you do not understand what is going on here then go back to watching mtv
JEd,positive,optimization if classofstaticmethod is set then we have already been here and determined that this is a static method invocation note maybe factor this out with path below clean up
JEd,positive,this will probably not get used object type
JEd,positive,windows jdk workaround
JEd,positive,this listener priority thing is a bad hack
JEd,positive,this does not look pretty and mode line should probably be split up into seperate components strings
JEd,positive,this is stupid and misleading but  path  is not used anywhere except the above line and if this is done after the  continue  then we will either hang or be forced to duplicate it inside the buffer null or add a  finally  clause you decide which one is worse
JEd,positive,workaround for hang if match was zero width not sure if there is a better way to handle this
JEd,positive,xxx magic number
JEd,positive,on windows paths of the form x list the last working directory on that drive to list the root of the drive you must use x however the vfs browser and friends strip off trailing path separators for various reasons so to work around that we add a to drive letter paths on windows
JEd,positive,on unix set permissions of port file to rw so that on broken unices which give everyone read access to user home dirs people ca not see your port file and hence send arbitriary beanshell code your way nasty
JEd,positive,? ? ? this should only be called with fully loaded action set
JEd,positive,broken eclipse workaround febuary
JEd,positive,notes this is broken it finds public but less specific methods over non public but more specific ones this method needs to be rewritten to eliminate findaccessiblemethod we should implement the findmostspecificmethod that uses the publiconly flag findmostspecificmethod should also operate in two passes to give standard java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches
JEd,positive,xxx this should not be hardcoded
JEd,positive,interval operator x x x y re intervals re no bk braces x x x y re intervals re no bk braces open question what is proper interpretation of at start of string ?
JEd,positive,xxx does this really belong here ?
JEd,positive,we do need to save every possible point but the number of clone invocations here is really a killer for performance on non stingy repeat operators i m open to suggestions
JEd,positive,note this should really just throw nosuchfieldexception need to change related signatures and code
JEd,positive,split the methods into constructors and regular method lists
JEd,positive,need to add static block here

JEd,negative, st step as explained above resizing an instruction may require to resize another one which may require to resize yet another one and so on the first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instructions that need to be resized without modifying the code this is done by the following fix point algorithm parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than bytes to be stored the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instructions for each such instruction adds an entry in a copy of the indexes and sizes arrays if this has not already been done in a previous iteration if at least one entry has been added during the previous step go back to the beginning otherwise stop in fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of tableswitch and lookupswitch instructions depends on their position in the bytecode because of padding in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the number of bytes to be added or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop is finished this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of the method

JFr,positive,fixme this attribute is not used deprecate ?
JFr,positive,todo by coding the event with some information about what changed in the dataset we could make the recalculation of the interval more efficient in some cases for instance if the change is just an update to a y value then the x interval does not need updating

JFr,positive,if we are rendering the values as percentages we need to calculate the total for the current item unfortunately here we end up repeating the calculation more times than is strictly necessary hopefully i will come back to this and find a way to add the total s to the renderer state the other problem is we implicitly assume the dataset has no negative values perhaps that can be fixed too
JFr,positive,defer argument checking
JFr,positive,note it would be nice to pre calculate this per series
JFr,positive,we assume that all other paint instances implement equals and hashcode of course that might not be true but what can we do about it ?

JFr,positive,defer argument checking
JFr,positive,all attributes are immutable so we can just return the super clone fixme in fact the generator itself is immutable so cloning is not necessary
JFr,positive,fixme we should really assert a value here
JFr,positive,here is a quirk the api has been defined in terms of a plain timeperiod which cannot make use of the timezone and locale specified in the constructor so we only do the time zone pegging if the period is an instanceof regulartimeperiod
JFr,positive,now handle specific plot types and yes i know this is some really ugly code that has to be manually updated any time a new plot type is added i should have written something much cooler but i did not and neither did anyone else
JFr,positive,todo urlencode ?

JMe,positive,i guess this can happen as a result of a bad file read ? in this case it would be better to replace the incorrect value with anything valid e g the default value for the property but for the time being i just prefer to be aware of any problems occuring here most likely programming errors so i will bail out ms note ca not bail out newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults also when loading previous versions of jmeter test scripts some values may not be right and should get default values ms todo review this and possibly change to

JMe,positive,todo temporary hack to avoid unnecessary bug reports for subclasses
JMe,positive,todo yet another ambiguous name does it need changing ? see also clearable jmeterguicomponent
JMe,positive,todo is this silent exception intended
JMe,positive,remember to change this when the class changes
JMe,positive,the following variables are set by standardjmeterengine this is done before start is called so the values will be published to the thread safely todo consider passing them to the constructor so that they can be made final to avoid adding lots of parameters perhaps have a parameter wrapper object
JMe,positive,todo should this set the thread names for all the subsamples ? might be more efficient than fetching the name elsewehere
JMe,positive,setting samplingstarted before the contollers are initialised allows them to access the running values of functions and variables however it does not seem to help with the listeners
JMe,positive,todo remove this useless entry parameter
JMe,positive,todo fix this when there is a real implementation
JMe,positive,todo only clear the relevant entry if possible
JMe,positive,surely this is always null in the constructor ?
JMe,positive,todo why not use the super class value ?
JMe,positive,todo does not appear to be called directly
JMe,positive,custom trustmanager ignores all certificate errors todo implement conditional checking and logging derived from authsslx trustmanager in httpclient contrib directory
JMe,positive,maps to contain page and form encodings todo do these really need to be shared between all proxy instances ?
JMe,positive,note source and line arguments are nonsense in a call any way to make these arguments sensible ?
JMe,positive,is it an exception wrapped in a javascriptexception ?
JMe,positive,todo why empty block ?
JMe,positive,todo perhaps this should be a fatal error ?

JMe,positive,todo only called by userparameterxmlparser getxmlparameters which is a deprecated class
JMe,positive,todo probably not needed
JMe,positive,todo move to jorphanutils ?
JMe,positive,todo needs to be synch ? probably not changed after threads have started jmeter home directory excludes trailing separator jmeter bin directory excludes trailing separator

JMe,positive,todo only clear the relevant entry if possible
JMe,positive,todo what is this for ?
JMe,positive,todo should equals and hashcode depend on field other than count ?
JMe,positive,todo is sync really needed ?
JMe,positive,todo is this correct ?
JMe,positive,todo cpercent is the same as cmedian here why ? and why pass it to distributionline ?
JMe,positive,todo should equals and hashcode depend on field other than count ?
JMe,positive,todo does this method need to be public ? it is not currently called outside of this class
JMe,positive,todo should the method signature of this method be changed to match the super implementation using a testelement parameter instead of abstractlistenerelement ? this would require an instanceof check before adding the listener below but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for sub classes the java rules dealing with this situation are not always intuitive and a subclass may think it is calling this version of the method when it is really calling the superclass version instead
JMe,positive,todo should this method be synchronized ? all other function execute are
JMe,positive,todo should the engine be static ?
JMe,positive,n b commons io ioutils has equivalent methods these were added before io was included todo perhaps deprecate these in favour of commons io ?
JMe,positive,todo should this be getmin ?
JMe,positive,fix bug d arg arg was causing parse error however define arg arg is ok this seems to be because the parser skips the terminator for the long options but was not doing so for the short options

JMe,positive,todo improve the error handling
JMe,positive,add logtargets to root logger fixme what is the clean way to add a logtarget afterwards ? param logtargets logtarget array
JMe,positive,hack to reduce the need to load every class in non gui mode which only needs functions todo perhaps use bcel to scan class files instead ? class name should contain this string class name should not contain this string
JMe,positive,todo exact ordering is only required for some tests change the comparison to do a set compare where necessary
JMe,positive,todo field always true what for ?
JMe,positive,todo improve this check

JMe,positive,method is broken anyway
JMe,positive,todo should really return most specific i e longest match
JMe,positive,todo should this be done for embedded usage ? note the element is a configtestelement when used standalone so we cannot use ftpsampler access methods
JMe,positive,todo replace all this url mess with a proper method areequivalent url url that would also ignore case in protocol and host names etc use that method in the cookiemanager too
JMe,positive,todo is this possible ?
JMe,positive,holder for storing cache details perhaps add original response later ?
JMe,positive,todo not used by gui
JMe,positive,not currently used
JMe,positive,todo correct url ?
JMe,positive,note the handling of simple vs double quotes could be formally more accurate but i ca not imagine a session id containing either so we should be ok the whole set of expressions is a quick hack anyway so who cares
JMe,positive,todo fix this when there is a real implementation
JMe,positive,todo improve string version to better match browser behaviour ? e g do browsers regard http host and http host as the same ? if so it would be better to reflect this in the string
JMe,positive,code also allows for lf only not sure why perhaps because the test code uses it ?
JMe,positive,hack to skip processing
JMe,positive,todo find a way to avoid the cost of creating a string here probably a new patternmatcherinput working on a byte would do better
JMe,positive,todo should setbaseforscript be called here rather than above ?
JMe,positive,java no longer allows content length to be set so do not check it see http bugs sun com bugdatabase view bug do ? bug id todo any point in checking the other headers ?
JMe,positive,sampleevent is not passed jmetervariables because they do not make sense for proxy recording todo is this the correct threadgroup name ?

JMe,positive,non nls todo should this be a variable ?
JMe,positive,hack to skip processing
JMe,positive,todo replace repeated substr above and below with more efficient method

JMe,positive,wo not work writeerrortoclient httpreplyhdr forminternalerror generate result if nec and populate it hack to skip processing
JMe,positive,todo should this be done when the client is created ? if so then the details need to be added as part of httpclientkey

JMe,positive,todo make static ?
JMe,positive,hack to allow entire url to be provided in host field

JMe,positive,todo needed here because currently done on sample completion in jmeterthread but that only catches top level samples
JMe,positive,todo this is a bit fragile
JMe,positive,todo is this correct ? if this is not the first file we ca not write its header now for simplicity we always save it even if there is only one file
JMe,positive,remember to change this when the class changes
JMe,positive,todo should this return something else ?
JMe,positive,do not allow override of content length this helps with soapsampler hack too todo what other headers are not allowed ?

JMe,positive,todo merge put and post methods as far as possible e g post checks for multipart form files and if not invokes senddata httpentityenclosingrequestbase

JMe,positive,todo is this the correct default ?
JMe,positive,todo is this the correct default ?
JMe,positive,todo should we allow mimetype only ?
JMe,positive,todo should these fields be public ? they do not appear to be used externally also are they any different from httpconstants get etc ? in some cases they seem to be used as the method name from the tomcat log however the rmethod field is used as the value for httpsamplerbase method for which httpconstants is most approriate
JMe,positive,notused org apache jmeter monitor model status st todo charset ?

JMe,positive,jmetertreenode and testbeangui are special gui classes and are not intended to be added to menus todo find a better way of checking this
JMe,positive,menubar related methods todo do we really need to have all these menubar methods duplicated here ? perhaps we can make the menu bar accessible through guipackage ?

JMe,positive,this could perhaps be a variable name
JMe,positive,results setresponsecode ? ? ? todo what code should be set here ?

JMe,positive,todo is it the best way ? https issues apache org bugzilla show bug cgi ? id
JMe,positive,keep the unexpanded path todo allow directories to end with jar by removing this check ?

JMe,positive,should header be saved with the data ? non nls
JMe,positive,should header be saved with the data ? non nls
JMe,positive,showing large strings can be very costly so we will avoid doing so if the response data is larger than k todo instead we could delay doing the result settext call until the user chooses the response data tab plus we could warn the user if this happens and revert the choice if he does not confirm he is ready to wait
JMe,positive,n b needs to implement visualizer so that testbeangui can find the correct gui class
JMe,positive,todo strings should be resources

JMe,positive,todo save hostname save sample type plain or http
JMe,positive,allow the mimetype of the file to control the content type this is not obvious in gui if you are not uploading any files but just sending the content of nameless parameters todo needs a multiple file upload scenerio
JMe,positive,remind convert arg list vectors here ?
JMe,positive,it is chunked transfer encoding which we do not really support yet so we just read without blocking because we do not know when to stop reading so we cannot block todo propery implement support for chunked transfer i e to know when we have read the whole request and therefore allow the reading to block

JRu,positive,using ioinputstream may not be the most performance way but it is easy
JRu,positive,fixme we should not be regenerating this over and over
JRu,positive,xxx this check previously used callmethod to check for equality between classes when scanning the hierarchy however the check may be safe we should only ever have one instance bound to a given type constant if it is found to be unsafe examine ways to avoid the call
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here confirm jruby
JRu,positive,todo why are we duplicating the constants here and then in file constants below ? file constants is included in io
JRu,positive,a cloned method now belongs to a new class set it todo make dynamicmethod immutable
JRu,positive,todo these were missing so we  re not handling them elsewhere ?
JRu,positive,todo cache ?
JRu,positive,fixme wtf is this ? why would these use the class ?
JRu,positive,todo figure out how this can happen and possibly remove
JRu,positive,fixme i do not like this
JRu,positive,fixme these descriptions should probably be moved out to constantine project which deals with all platform dependent constants
JRu,positive,fixme this below is temporary but its much safer for cow it prevents not shared strings with begin this allows now e g bytelist set not to be begin aware
JRu,positive,todo what about n arg ?
JRu,positive,fixme i think this chunk is equivalent to mri id name and not our public method id name make into method if used more than once
JRu,positive,todo cache ?
JRu,positive,fixme this is probably not very efficient since it loads all methods for each call
JRu,positive,hack in to replace usual readline with this
JRu,positive,if we get here we found a matching method use it todo choose narrowest method by continuing to search
JRu,positive,todo this is kinda gross
JRu,positive,fixme in order for thread to play well with the standard  new  behavior it must provide an allocator that can create empty object instances which initialize then fills with appropriate data
JRu,positive,these extra arrays are really unfortunate split some of these paths out to eliminate ?
JRu,positive,we clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block any previously captured instances of this block may still be around and we do not want to start overwriting those values when we create a new one enebo once we make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable we can remove duplicate
JRu,positive,todo protected methods this is going to require a rework of some of the mechanism
JRu,positive,if not overloaded we add a method that guesses at which signature to use todo just adding first one right now add in signature guessing logic
JRu,positive,sss fixme this should never get called for constant svalues
JRu,positive,todo this version is better than the hackish previous one windows behavior needs to be defined though i suppose this version could be improved more too todo etc passwd is also inadequate for macosx since it does not use etc passwd for regular user accounts
JRu,positive,fixme there is some code duplication here with rubyobject inspect
JRu,positive,for visibility checking without requiring frame self todo do not bother passing when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately
JRu,positive,fixme figure out why we get null sometimes
JRu,positive,hacky advance position to eat newline here
JRu,positive,need to reexamine this
JRu,positive,fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
JRu,positive,workaround for jruby
JRu,positive,using iooutputstream may not be the most performance way but it is easy
JRu,positive,ignore bean does not get registered todo why does that bother me ?
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here confirm jruby
JRu,positive,enebo lots of optz in parser here
JRu,positive,fixme move out of this class
JRu,positive,in fact we should probably raise an error yes ?
JRu,positive,todo ary sort check should be done here
JRu,positive,todo get rid of this lax returns strict will throw
JRu,positive,bit risky if someone changes completor but useful for method calls
JRu,positive,todo the rest of this seeking to same position is unnecessary since we share a channel but some of this may be needed ?
JRu,positive,todo is this the right thing to do ?
JRu,positive,fixme this probably belongs in a different package
JRu,positive,fixme not very efficient
JRu,positive,we clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block any previously captured instances of this block may still be around and we do not want to start overwriting those values when we create a new one enebo once we make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable we can remove duplicate
JRu,positive,this is gross but java api is are not iso compliant at all
JRu,positive,todo is this correct ?
JRu,positive,workaround for jruby mri does not enter this production for some reason
JRu,positive,create block for this iter node fixme we should not use the current scope if it is not actually from the same hierarchy of static scopes
JRu,positive,sss fixme do we need to check if l is same as whatever popped ?
JRu,positive,sss fixme where is this set up ? how is this diff from classvardeclnode ? ?
JRu,positive,fixme do we need the check or does main java not call this they should consolidate
JRu,positive,fixme this table will get moved into posix library so we can get all actual supported signals this is a quick fix to support basic signals until that happens
JRu,positive,fixme this worries me a bit since it could allocate a lot with a large newlength
JRu,positive,todo this filtering is kind of gross it would be nice to get some parser help here
JRu,positive,todo decompose getjavapackagemodule so we do not parse fullname
JRu,positive,this is gross but java api is are not iso compliant at all
JRu,positive,fixme get rid of laziness and handle restricted access elsewhere
JRu,positive,todo for now we use a faithful reimplementation of mri is algorithm but should use utf encoding facilities from joni once it starts prefroming utf content validation
JRu,positive,if we do not have opt args start after args they will be assigned later this is for crap like def foo a b true which numbers b before a fixme only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileroot using to indicate signature
JRu,positive,fixme determine if a real allocator is needed here do people want to extend javaclass ? do we want them to do that ? can you class new javaclass ? should you be able to ? todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it ca not be marshalled confirm jruby
JRu,positive,grrr arghh want to subclass sun misc floatingdecimal but ca not so we must do all this the next lines of code which has already been done by floatingdecimal
JRu,positive,fixme do we really want  declared  methods ? includes private protected and does not include superclass methods also the getdeclared calls may throw securityexception if we  re running under a restrictive security policy
JRu,positive,small hack to save a cast later on
JRu,positive,this is perhaps innefficient timewise ? optimal spacewise
JRu,positive,todo confirm expected args are irubyobject or similar
JRu,positive,there is not a compelling reason to keep javaclass instances in a weak map any proxies created are were kept in a non weak map so in most cases they will stick around anyway and some good reasons not to javaclass creation is expensive for one many lookups are performed when passing parameters to from methods etc todo faster custom concurrent map
JRu,positive,todo check for java reserved names and raise exception if encountered
JRu,positive,fixme jruby ends up with condition returning null quick fix until i can dig into it
JRu,positive,workaround for a bug in sun is jdk x see http bugs sun com bugdatabase view bug do ? bug id
JRu,positive,fixme weakref rb also does caller here for the backtrace
JRu,positive,fixme remove this from grammars
JRu,positive,todo it is perhaps just a coincidence that all the channels for which we should raise are instanceof selectablechannel since stdio is not so this bothers me slightly con
JRu,positive,fixme not sure what the semantics of transfer are cfiber definefastmethod transfer cb getfastoptmethod transfer
JRu,positive,fixme this is pretty gross we should have a cleaner initialization that does not depend on package visible fields and ideally is atomic probably using an immutable structure we replace all at once lazy null when no groups defined
JRu,positive,this is a dummy scope we should find a way to make that more explicit
JRu,positive,fixme resolve what the hell is going on
JRu,positive,rb obj id return the internal id of an object fixme should this be renamed to match its ruby name ?
JRu,positive,again should not happen todo might want to throw exception instead
JRu,positive,fixme maybe not best place but move it to a good home
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator may be ok here but it is unclear how structs work with marshalling confirm behavior and ensure we  re doing this correctly jruby
JRu,positive,todo should next and return also catch here ?
JRu,positive,we always prepend an org jruby proxy package to the beginning because java and javax packages are protected and signed jars prevent us generating new classes with those package names see jruby
JRu,positive,todo we should be able to optimize this quite a bit post javaclass already has all the methods organized by method name the next version supporting protected methods fields will have them organized even further so collectmethods here can just lookup the overridden methods in the javaclass map should be much faster
JRu,positive,index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end ?
JRu,positive,todo make more efficient by not creating irubyarray
JRu,positive,rb mod remove cvar fixme any good reason to have two identical methods ? same as remove class variable
JRu,positive,from dup setup rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here unlikely
JRu,positive,if we do not have opt args start after args they will be assigned later this is for crap like def foo a b true which numbers b before a fixme only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileroot using to indicate signature
JRu,positive,if it is a single arg when but contains an array we know it is a real literal array fixme this is a gross way to figure it out parser help similar to yield argument passing expandarguments would be better
JRu,positive,todo only setaccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non public interface aka java util zip zipconstants being implemented by many classes
JRu,positive,not intended to be called directly by users private old todo from ruby code this should be implemented in javaclass java where we can check for reserved ruby names conflicting methods etc
JRu,positive,fixme do not allow multiple threads to do this at once
JRu,positive,todo bleeding runtime into parser arity may be should be in parser to keep bleeding oneway
JRu,positive,rb ary push m fixme whis is this named push m ?
JRu,positive,todo this probably is not the best hack but it works until we can have different root frame setup for easily
JRu,positive,todo at least parsersupport attrset passes argsnode as null implicitnil is wrong magic for setupargs since it will irubyobject nil so we need to figure out a nice fast null pattern for setupargs assert argsnode null receivernode is not null
JRu,positive,hack in order to have stdout err act like ttys and flush always we set anything assigned to stdout stderr to sync
JRu,positive,fixme not very efficient
JRu,positive,todo people extending gzipwriter reader will break find better way here
JRu,positive,fixme set up a call configuration for this
JRu,positive,process streams get channel newchannel ed into filechannel but are not actually seekable so instead of just the isseekable check doing instanceof filechannel we must also add this boolean to check which we set to false when it is known that the incoming channel is from a process fixme this is gross and it is nio is fault for not providing a nice way to tell if a channel is really seekable
JRu,positive,again should not happen todo might want to throw exception instead
JRu,positive,fixme somehow i  d feel better if this could get the appropriate var index from the argumentnode
JRu,positive,fixme can get optimized for ieqlnode
JRu,positive,todo rounding mode should not be hard coded see mode
JRu,positive,fixme moved this here to get what is obviously a utility method out of irubyobject perhaps security methods should find their own centralized home at some point
JRu,positive,fixme if nativeexception is expected to be used from ruby code it should provide a real allocator to be used otherwise class new will fail as will marshalling jruby
JRu,positive,object to a is obsolete we match ruby is hack until to a goes away then we can remove this hack too
JRu,positive,todo callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost constants are rarely assigned
JRu,positive,fixme this should go somewhere more generic maybe idutil
JRu,positive,sss fixme move this code to some utils area or probably there is already a method for this in some jruby utils class holy cow just to append two darned arrays
JRu,positive,todo set our metaclass to target is class i e scary
JRu,positive,add  new  with full signature so it is guaranteed to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature
JRu,positive,context is null wipe out the softreference this could be done with a reference queue
JRu,positive,todo remove
JRu,positive,fixme not very efficient
JRu,positive,fixme big fat hack here because scope names are expected to be interned strings by the parser
JRu,positive,todo this is actually now returning the scope of whoever called method to proc which is obviously wrong but there is no scope to provide for many methods it fixes jruby but needs a better solution
JRu,positive,author headius fixme convert to enum ?
JRu,positive,the following three methods must be defined fast since they expect to modify the current frame i e they expect no frame will be allocated for them jruby
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it ca not be marshalled confirm jruby
JRu,positive,sss fixme can this return anything other than nil ?
JRu,positive,xxx const lookup can trigger const missing is that enough to warrant it always being executed ?
JRu,positive,for visibility checking without requiring frame self todo do not bother passing when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately
JRu,positive,todo should frozen error have its own distinct class ? if not should more share ?
JRu,positive,todo only used by interface implementation eliminate it
JRu,positive,fixme null check is removable once we figure out how to assign to unset named block args
JRu,positive,for jruby when met choose cet timezone to work around joda
JRu,positive,fixme this is gross do not do this
JRu,positive,fixme i think we need these pushed somewhere ?
JRu,positive,sss fixme deprecated going forward all instructions should come from the cfg
JRu,positive,todo should probably apply the null object pattern for a non allowed class rather than null
JRu,positive,todo should next and return also catch here ?
JRu,positive,yow this is still ugly
JRu,positive,add method with full signature so it is guaranteed to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature
JRu,positive,fixme this version is faster than the previous but both suffer from a crucial flaw it is impossible to create an objectspace with an iterator that does not either a hold on to objects that might otherwise be collected or b have no way to guarantee that a call to hasnext will be correct or that a subsequent call to next will produce an object for our purposes for now this may be acceptable
JRu,positive,fixme clearing read buffer here is this appropriate ?
JRu,positive,todo specifying soft refs may want to compare memory consumption behavior with weak refs specify weak in place of soft below
JRu,positive,fixme lose syntactical elements here and others like this
JRu,positive,enebo totally weird naming in mri is not allocated and is a local var name
JRu,positive,fixme this does not actually support anything but string
JRu,positive,up to ten stuff into tmp locals load in reverse order and assign fixme there is probably a slightly smarter way but is it important ?
JRu,positive,xxx do something ?
JRu,positive,todo only setaccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non public interface aka java util zip zipconstants being implemented by many classes todo not sure we need this at all since we only expose public fields field setaccessible true
JRu,positive,fixme we want to eliminate these type casts when possible
JRu,positive,todo decompose getjavapackagemodule so we do not parse fullname
JRu,positive,hack force clinit to be created
JRu,positive,fixme if true array is common enough we should pre allocate and stick somewhere
JRu,positive,optional args so we have irubyobject todo confirm
JRu,positive,todo this is almost rubymodule instance methods on the metaclass perhaps refactor
JRu,positive,fixme added this because marshal spec seemed to reconstitute objects without calling datawrapstruct this resulted in object being null after unmarshalling
JRu,positive,todo factor this chunk as in mri yarv getaster
JRu,positive,todo ary sort check should be done here
JRu,positive,exit monitor before making call fixme this not being in a finally is a little worrisome
JRu,positive,self args sss fixme verify that this is correct
JRu,positive,this is for jruby since after a suspend the terminal seems to need to be reinitialized since we ca not easily detect suspension initialize after every readline probably not fast but this is for interactive terminals anyway so who cares ?
JRu,positive,todo do above but not below for additional newline nodes
JRu,positive,sss fixme receiver this is the class meta object basically ? operand receiver build defsnode getreceivernode s
JRu,positive,fixme this whole thing could probably be implemented as a module and mixed into appropriate classes especially if it uses either ioinput outputstream or is smart about the kind of io like object it is being used against
JRu,positive,fixme bit of a kludge here non interface classes assigned to both class and module fields simplifies proxy extender code will go away when ji is overhauled and proxy extenders are deprecated
JRu,positive,fixme what should these really be ? numeric ? assert x instanceof rubycomplex y instanceof rubycomplex
JRu,positive,we  re depending on the side effect of the load which loads the class but does not turn it into a script i do not like it but until we restructure the code a bit more we will need to quietly let it by here
JRu,positive,fixme we should also support orgs that use capitalized package names including embarrassingly the one i work for but this should be enabled by a system property as the expected default behavior for an upper case value should be and is to treat it as a class name and raise an exception if it is not found
JRu,positive,index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end ?
JRu,positive,todo this version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it does not perhaps no difference for us ?
JRu,positive,fixme this is temporary since the variable compilers assume we want args already on stack for assignment we just pop and continue with args logic
JRu,positive,todo eliminate ?
JRu,positive,todo confirm expected args are irubyobject or similar
JRu,positive,todo handle writing into original buffer better
JRu,positive,this is a fairly specific hack for empty string but it does the job
JRu,positive,xxx this constructor is a hack to implement the end syntax converting a reader back into an inputstream does not generally work
JRu,positive,method has more than lines we will need to split it and therefore need to use a heap based scope
JRu,positive,the implementations of these are all bonus see todo above i was going to throw an error from these but it appears to be the wrong place to do it
JRu,positive,todo confirm expected args are irubyobject or similar
JRu,positive,entry exists proxy does not match replace this could happen if old proxy was gc ed todo raise exception if stored proxy is non null ? not gc ed
JRu,positive,todo better algorithm to set precision needed
JRu,positive,sss fixme used anywhere ? i do not see calls to this anywhere public operand builddasgnassignment node node ir scope s dasgnnode dasgnnode dasgnnode node s getvariablecompiler assignlocalvariable dasgnnode getindex dasgnnode getdepth
JRu,positive,todo make this more intelligible value
JRu,positive,todo split this into two sub classes so that name and constnode can be specified seperately
JRu,positive,not sure how well this works but it works much better than just currenttimemillis by itself
JRu,positive,fixme this is copied code from rubyarray both re struct and array should share one impl this is also hacky since i construct ruby objects to access ruby arrays through aref instead of something lower
JRu,positive,fixme no i do not like it
JRu,positive,ignore bean does not get registered todo why does that bother me ?
JRu,positive,fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
JRu,positive,arguments compilers always create irubyobject but we want to use rubyarray concat here fixme as a result this is not efficient since it creates and then later unwraps an array
JRu,positive,sss fixme what is the difference between classvarasgnnode classvardeclnode
JRu,positive,fixme set up a callconfiguration for this
JRu,positive,todo reads writes from frame todo information on scoping todo visibility ?
JRu,positive,fixme somehow i  d feel better if this could get the appropriate var index from the argumentnode
JRu,positive,fixme this is almost entirely duplicated from main java
JRu,positive,we might need to perform a dst correction
JRu,positive,fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
JRu,positive,create block for this iter node fixme we should not use the current scope if it is not actually from the same hierarchy of static scopes
JRu,positive,fixme how much more obtuse can this be ? heredoc already parsed this and saved string do not parse just return
JRu,positive,this needs to be split since conditional calling inherited does not fit standard ruby semantics
JRu,positive,xxx again screwy evaling under previous frame is scope
JRu,positive,sss fixme maybe this is not really a concern after all nesting level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scopes in the current file this is not to be confused with semantic nesting of scopes across files consider this code in a file f class m m m c end so c is at lexical nesting level of the file script is at in the file  f  semantically it is at level m m m are at this is primarily used to ensure that variable names do not clash i e definition of v in a closure should not override the use of v from the parent scope private int lexicalnestinglevel
JRu,positive,ignore bean does not get registered todo why does that bother me ?
JRu,positive,actual type does not exactly match method return type re get converter fixme when the only autoconversions are primitives this wo not be needed
JRu,positive,fixme we should probably still be dyncalling  write  here
JRu,positive,fixme finalizer should be dupped here
JRu,positive,do not bother to check if final method it wo not be there not generated ca not be
JRu,positive,todo generalize this type checking code into irubyobject helper
JRu,positive,fixme needs to be rethought
JRu,positive,ruby constants for strings should this be moved somewhere else ?
JRu,positive,let is only generate methods for those the user may actually intend to override that includes any defined in the current class and any ancestors that are also javaproxyclasses but none from any other ancestor classes methods defined in mixins will be considered intentionally overridden except those from kernel java and javaproxymethods as well as enumerable todo may want to exclude other common mixins ?
JRu,positive,fixme i do not like the null checks here
JRu,positive,invoke callmethodmissing method directly todo this could be further optimized since some dsls hit method missing pretty hard
JRu,positive,todo confirm expected args are irubyobject or similar
JRu,positive,todo this is really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone require is something we should try to make loadpath a special array object
JRu,positive,if we get here we found a matching method use it todo choose narrowest method by continuing to search
JRu,positive,rb obj id return the internal id of an object fixme should this be renamed to match its ruby name ?
JRu,positive,fixme why was this using a fullfunctioncallbackmethod before that did callsuper ?
JRu,positive,if body is a rescue node inspect its pieces separately to avoid it disabling all optz todo this is gross
JRu,positive,fixme this does not have exact same semantics as rubyarray join but they probably could be consolidated perhaps as join args sep dochomp
JRu,positive,lame generics issues making segment class static and manually inserting cache reference to work around various problems generically referencing methods vars across classes
JRu,positive,fixme not very efficient
JRu,positive,fixme this determine module is in a strange location and should somehow be in block
JRu,positive,todo ? i think this ends up propagating from normal java exceptions sys fail openfile getpath
JRu,positive,this seems unlikely to happen unless it is a totally bogus fileno so do we even need to bother trying to create one ?
JRu,positive,todo turn off the negative ? will return in lax mode
JRu,positive,todo list sublist from to clear is supposed to clear the sublist from the list how can we support this operation ?
JRu,positive,sss fixme what is the difference between classvarasgnnode classvardeclnode
JRu,positive,see note below re field kludge
JRu,positive,we  re not setting the provider or anything but it seems that bouncycastle does some internal things in its provider is constructor which require it to be executed in a secure context ideally this hack should be removed see jruby and this bc bug http www bouncycastle org jira browse bja
JRu,positive,this is a rather ugly hack but similar to mri see hash c ruby setenv and similar in mri we search all keys for a case insensitive match and use that
JRu,positive,todo wrong get interfaces from class
JRu,positive,todo make callcoerced work in block context then fix downto step and upto
JRu,positive,fixme the code below is a copy of rubyio puts and we should avoid copy paste
JRu,positive,install invokedynamic bootstrapper todo need to abstract this setup behind another compiler interface
JRu,positive,fixme inefficient constructing a bignum just for dumping ?
JRu,positive,todo ruby does not seem to care about invalid numeric mode values i am not sure if ruby overflows here also
JRu,positive,fixme obvious issue that not all platforms can display all attributes ugly hacks using generic posix library makes pushing inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful
JRu,positive,rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here unlikely
JRu,positive,fixme this really ought to be in clinit but it does not matter much
JRu,positive,todo callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost constants are rarely assigned
JRu,positive,using iochannel may not be the most performant way but it is easy
JRu,positive,todo this should entry into error handling somewhere
JRu,positive,todo make this do specific arity calling
JRu,positive,fixme legal here ? may want unsupportedoperationexception
JRu,positive,fixme this is an ugly hack to resolve jruby i m not proud of it
JRu,positive,for visibility checking without requiring frame self todo do not bother passing when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately
JRu,positive,sss fixme what happens to the add class in this case ? ?
JRu,positive,sss fixme is this correct ?
JRu,positive,fixme big fat hack here because scope names are expected to be interned strings by the parser
JRu,positive,ignore bean does not get registered todo why does that bother me ?
JRu,positive,sss fixme are we guaranteed that we splats dont head to multiple assignment nodes i e a b ?
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here confirm jruby
JRu,positive,todo catch exception if constant is already set by other thread
JRu,positive,todo this version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it does not perhaps no difference for us ?
JRu,positive,todo implement tty ? and isatty we have no real capability to determine this from java but if we could set tty status then we could invoke jruby differently to allow stdin to return true on this this would allow things like cgi rb to work properly
JRu,positive,fixme we should be getting this from the runtime rather than assume none ? return runtime getencodingservice getencoding runtime getdefaultexternalencoding
JRu,positive,object to a is obsolete we match ruby is hack until to a goes away then we can remove this hack too
JRu,positive,end hack
JRu,positive,todo this is not an exact port of mri is pipe behavior so revisit
JRu,positive,todo protected methods this is going to require a rework of some of the mechanism
JRu,positive,fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
JRu,positive,todo factor this chunk as in mri yarv getaster
JRu,positive,fixme what should this really be ? assert x instanceof rubycomplex
JRu,positive,fixme this is not right for within ensured rescued code
JRu,positive,sss fixme token can be final for a method implying that the token is only for this particular implementation of the method but if the mehod is modified we create a new method object which in turn gets a new token what makes sense ? ? intuitively it seems the first one but let us see current code version token for this method can change during execution as methods get redefined
JRu,positive,todo it would be nice to throw a better error for this
JRu,positive,set up a field for the cacheentry todo make this an array so it is not as much class metadata similar to abstractscript stuff
JRu,positive,todo it would be nice to throw a better error for this
JRu,positive,todo newtypeerror does not offer enough for ruby error string
JRu,positive,sss fixme i added this in is this correct ?
JRu,positive,upper case package name todo top level upper case package was supported in the previous ruby based implementation so leaving as is see note at getproxyorpackageunderpackage re future approach below the top level
JRu,positive,todo wire into new exception handling mechanism
JRu,positive,todo this is also defined in the metaclass too consolidate somewhere
JRu,positive,fixme constdecl could be two seperate classes or done differently since constnode and name never exist at the same time
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it ca not be marshalled confirm jruby
JRu,positive,fixme finalizer should be dupped here
JRu,positive,todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it ca not be marshalled confirm jruby
JRu,positive,todo number formatting here mri uses g api is a must ?
JRu,positive,todo need to get this back into the method signature now is too late
JRu,positive,super calls from proxies must use reflected method fixme possible to make handles do the superclass call ?
JRu,positive,optional args so we have irubyobject todo confirm
JRu,positive,todo better error handling
JRu,positive,fixme not very efficient
JRu,positive,sss fixme should this be operand or compoundstring ? can it happen that symbols are built out of other than compound strings ? or can it happen during optimizations that this becomes a generic operand ?
JRu,positive,fixme we should really not be creating the dynamic scope for the root of the ast before parsing this makes us end up needing to readjust this dynamic scope coming out of parse and for local static scopes it will always happen because of and fixme because we end up adjusting this after the fact we ca not use any of the specific size scopes
JRu,positive,todo wire into new exception handling mechanism
JRu,positive,todo not sure that we should skip calling join altogether thread join has some implications for java memory model etc
JRu,positive,hack to get right style for input
JRu,positive,if variables were added then we may need to grow the dynamic scope to match the static one fixme make this so we only need to check this for blockscope null we cannot currently since we create the dynamicscope for a localstaticscope before parse begins refactoring should make this fixable
JRu,positive,sss fixme this method at least in the context of multiple assignment is a little weird it calls regular to ary on the object but if it encounters a method missing the value is inserted into an element array try a b c first then define fixnum to ary method and try it again ex http gist github com
JRu,positive,fixme potentially could just use bytelist here ?
JRu,positive,fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
JRu,positive,fixme consider fixing node assign itself rather than single case
JRu,positive,this is perhaps innefficient timewise ? optimal spacewise
JRu,positive,end hack
JRu,positive,ignore job was cancelled fixme is this ok ?
JRu,positive,regular division with some default precision todo proper algorithm to set the precision
JRu,positive,todo exec should replace the current process this could be possible with jna
JRu,positive,sometimes the value can be retrieved at compile time if we succeed nothing like it we might not for the following reasons the constant is missing the reference is a forward reference the constant is value is only known at run time on first access but this is runtime is not it ? ? our compiler is not able to right away infer that this is a constant sss fixme the operand can be a literal array range or hash hence operand because array range and hash derive from operand and not constant is there a way to fix this impedance mismatch ? it should be possible to handle the forward reference case by creating a new forwardreference operand and then inform the scope of the forward reference which the scope can fix up when the reference gets defined at code gen time if the reference is unresolved when a value is retrieved for the forward ref and we get a null we can throw a constmissing exception not sure
JRu,positive,fixme not allocatable allocator is probably not right here since we might eventually want javaarray to be marshallable jruby
JRu,positive,workaround for jruby mri does not enter this production for some reason
JRu,positive,if body is a rescue node inspect its pieces separately to avoid it disabling all optz todo this is gross

JRu,positive,fixme do we really want  declared  methods ? includes private protected and does not include superclass methods
JRu,positive,fixme should not need java ovrd methods just query locally defined methods
JRu,positive,fixme document difference between warn and warning or rename one better
JRu,positive,fixme only f setfl and f getfl is current supported fixme only nonblock flag is supported fixme f setfl and f setfd are treated as the same thing here for the case of dup fd we should actually have f setfl only affect one it is unclear how well we do but this todo is here to at least document that we might need to do more work here mostly setfl is for mode changes which should persist across fork boundaries since jvm has no fork this is not a problem for us
JRu,positive,todo call config with scope but no frame

JRu,positive,todo must override in rubymodule to pick up constants
JRu,positive,todo non strict option
JRu,positive,todo adjust length so it wo not fall in the middle of a multi byte character mri is sprintf c uses tables in a modified version of regex c which assume some particular encoding for a given installation application see regex c re mbcinit in ruby p this is only an issue if the user specifies a precision that causes the string to be truncated the same issue would arise taking a substring of a bytelist backed rubystring

JRu,positive,todo check if too many open files gc and try again
JRu,positive,sss fixme cannot optimize this without assuming that range to ary method has not redefined so for now return null
JRu,positive,todo this and recacherespondsto needed to be synchronized for jruby but this degraded performance nearly x it is still faster than mri but a reanalysis of this code may show a faster way to ensure we  re caching safely
JRu,positive,sss fixme to be done

JRu,negative,inside a loop break out of it go to end of loop leaving break value on stack
JRu,negative,interrupt the target thread in case it is blocking or waiting warning we no longer interrupt the target thread since this usually means interrupting io and with nio that means the channel is no longer usable we either need a new way to handle waking a target thread that is waiting on io or we need to accept that we ca not wake such threads and must wait for them to complete their operation threadimpl interrupt
JRu,negative,ignore switch

JRu,negative,foo are not getting set from somewhere i want the following assert to be true though assert variablevalues offset null getting unassigned staticscope getvariables offset
JRu,negative,check arity in the variable arity version
JRu,negative,the reason why we need the stream is to be able to invoke available on it stdin in java is non interruptible non selectable and attempt to read on such stream might lead to thread being blocked without any way to unblock it that is where available comes it so at least we could check whether anything is available to be read without blocking
JRu,negative,grab nil for local variables
JRu,negative,there are two different popular tz formats legacy ast gmt and newer one us pacific america los angeles this pattern is to detect the legacy tz format in order to convert it to the newer format understood by java api

JRu,negative,copy out any buffered bytes
JRu,negative,create the closure class and instantiate it
JRu,negative,ignore i do not like doing it but it seems like we really just need to make all channels non blocking by default and use select when implementing blocking ops so if this remains set non blocking perhaps it is not such a big deal

JRu,negative,deal with length width
JRu,negative,the problem we trying to solve below stdin in java is blocked and non interruptible so if we invoke read on it we might never be able to interrupt such thread so we use in available to see if there is any input ready and only then read it but this approach ca not tell whether the end of stream reached or not so we might end up looping right at the end of the stream well at least we can improve the situation by checking if some input was ever available and if so not checking for available anymore and just go to read
JRu,negative,now for all variables used by  i  mark them live before  i
JRu,negative,these are only needed if we have a non noop call config
JRu,negative,because regexp sets backref we have to make this backref aware
JRu,negative,note currently this optimization is limited to the following situations all expressions must be int ranged literal fixnums it also still emits the code for the safe when logic which is rather wasteful since it essentially doubles each code body as such it is normally disabled but it serves as an example of how this optimization could be done ideally it should be combined with the when processing to improve code reuse before it is generally available

JRu,negative,this relies on the ruby rounding enumerations java ones which they currently all are
JRu,negative,it is either as converted as we can make it via above logic or it is not one of the types we convert so just pass it out as is without wrapping
JRu,negative,a gotcha
JRu,negative,now we provide default impls of a number of signatures for each arity we first generate a non block version of the method which just adds null block and re calls allowing e g compiled code which always can potentially take a block to only generate the block receiving signature and still avoid arg boxing we then provide default implementations of each block accepting method that in turn call the irubyobject block version of call this then finally falls back on the minimum implementation requirement for dynamic method handles
JRu,negative,we get canonical path to try and flatten the path out a dir   subdir   should return as cnutter do we want to flatten path out ?

SQu,positive,fails on db for linux however windows fixpak driver works without exception also linux server with driver works fine as well
SQu,positive,bug ms sql is inconsistent with regard to setting the current catalog if you have a database with periods or spaces then in some cases you must surround the catalog with quotes for example if you have a catalog named  db with spaces  you must execute the following sql use db with spaces however the same is not always true for the jdbc api method connection setcatalog for some old versions of microsoft drivers you must quote the catalog as well but for newer versions of the driver you must not quote the catalog so here we attempt to use the unquoted version first then if that fails we will try quoting it

SQu,positive,issue after importing the data we could tell the user that it has been successfully imported this would give good positive feedback however it would mean that they need to click on yet another button to dismiss that message on the other hand since the operation is synchronous the user cannot proceed to do anything until it is done if we assume that import usually works correctly unless they are shown an error message then we do not need to display anything here
SQu,positive,todo this wo not work when the column has values with quotes in them use preparedstatements instead

SQu,positive,we are displaying a new dataset so if there was a cell editor in operation tell it to cancel ? ? ? ? how does this impact popup display ?
SQu,positive,kludge we want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations ideally we would get that info inside the resultsetdataset class during the creation of the columndefinition objects by using various functions in resultsetmetadata such as isnullable idx unfortunately in at least some dbmss e g postgres hsdb the results of those calls are not the same and are less accurate than the sqlmetadata getcolumns call used in columnstab to get the column info even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same with the resultsetmetadata listing things not provided by getcolumns most of the data provided by the resultsetmetadata calls is correct however the nullable not nullable property is not set correctly in at least two dbmss while it is correct for those dbmss in the getcolumns info therefore we collect the collumn nullability information from getcolumns and pass that info to the resultset to override what it got from the resultsetmetadata
SQu,positive,the utility class that reads and writes release info from to the release xml file todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
SQu,positive,todo this wo not work when the column has values with quotes in them use preparedstatements instead hmmm instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a uses the sequence for the pkid b selects distinct values that would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem
SQu,positive,the following only works if swingutilities getroot table returns and instanceof basemdiparentframe if swingtuilities getroot table returns and instance of dialog or frame then other code must be used
SQu,positive,need to somehow call sqlresultexecuterpanel rerunselectedresulttab true something like sqlresultexecuterpanel panel getpanel panel rerunselectedresulttab true however that does not apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table there needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders for now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually re run the query reload the table data and re export
SQu,positive,? ? split these functions off into a subclass of basefavouriteaction
SQu,positive,todo rename this to gettabletype
SQu,positive,todo bizarre that i could not find a valid sql to drop an index
SQu,positive,todo ? dialog handling on cancelled ?
SQu,positive,this refactoring depends on the following api methods getcreatetablesql
SQu,positive,should probably create my own table model but i am being a bit slack
SQu,positive,todo probably want to allow the user to set these sequence properties ? ? sequence settings
SQu,positive,we set expected and checksum to here since we do not have that information for release xml file todo can httpclient be used to get the byte size of release xml so we can perform this check ?
SQu,positive,here i do not completely understand how these types are to be used in all databases and i have not yet had time to implement support in the dialects for them so this exclude list will keep these less commonly used types from failing the test also since not all of these types appear in java and we currently support compiling the code base with it i use the integer values for new types that were introduces in java rather than the type constant name
SQu,positive,todo delete this class unused
SQu,positive,todo find out why kludge for some reason i am not able to get the sheet to size correctly it always displays with a size that causes the sub panels to have their scrollbars showing add a bit of an increase in the size of the panel so the scrollbars are not displayed
SQu,positive,copied from java doc matcher replaceall note that backslashes and dollar signs in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string

SQu,positive,todo delete me
SQu,positive,this refactoring depends on the following dialect api methods getupdatesql
SQu,positive,for pointbase if type maps to pointbase blob and the size is not valid pb requires size for blobs then set it to something reasonably large like mb is the default size if no size is specified that is practically useless
SQu,positive,should the data be first cloned so that the sorting does not take place on the array that is used in getvalue todo this is a must if sorting is done in a thread ? ?
SQu,positive,todo when is the earliest version supported add the following line setsurrendersfocusonkeystroke true this should help handle some problems with navigation using tab return to move through cells
SQu,positive,set the property values note this may have already been done by another instance of this datatype created to handle a different column
SQu,positive,drop fk constraints before dropping any tables otherwise we may drop the child table prior to dropping it is fks which would be an error todo this should be done in the dialect is gettabledropsql method for a database specific handling or ignoring of this problem
SQu,positive,silently ignore what could we do anyway ?
SQu,positive,this is a bit hard coded but if we use scale here some number displays go crazy
SQu,positive,todo figure out why the selection of the root node in the object tree is undone if we do not delay it seems like some other thread racing to set the selected node to none when this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when a session is first opened or when an objecttree frame is created this is a really crappy and unreliable way to fix this problem but it hides the problem for now a better understanding of the architecture of session creation is required before a proper solution can be attempted rmm
SQu,positive,todo temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido is fix assertequals second stmt sep qt getsqlstatementseparator
SQu,positive,todo maybe we should have a checkbox to allow the user to toggle default value on off some dbs like db treat empty string as a different default value than null

SQu,positive,check the error stream for a problem this is a bit questionable since it is possible for processes to output something on stderr but continue processing but without this some problems are not seen e g bad argument type messages from the process
SQu,positive,ok this is a hack currently when precision scale i have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data the problem comes when the source db is precision scale are greater or reported to be greater than the precision scale of the destination db in this case it maximimizes both for the destination causing a definition that allows digits to the left of the decimal trouble is without looking at the actual data there is no way to tell if this is valid in some cases it will be ok in others it will not be ok so for now make the scale be approx one half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases

SQu,positive,todo these should be handled with an iterator
SQu,positive,todo do we need this one
SQu,positive,this is a logically not sufficent try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the jdbc api doc statement getresultset this method should be called only once per result statement getupdatecount this method should be called only once per result statement getmoreresults there are no more results when the following is true getmoreresults getupdatecount if getmoreresults returns false we do not know if we have more results we only know that it is not a result set since we called getupdatecount before getmoreresults because we would like to know the update count of the first result we might not be allowed to call getupdatecount again the intersystems cache driver for example always returns the same updatecount on simple insert update delete statements not matter if getmoreresults was called so updatecount never gets and this will loop forever when i discussed the issue with the intersystems people they just told me not to call getupdatecount twice that simple my hope is that this will cure problems with dbs that just do not care for multiple result sets
SQu,positive,required otherwise it gets too wide

SQu,positive,todo what i really want to do here is get the sql script and replace create procedure with alter procedure then put that in the sql pane and not execute it
SQu,positive,todo should i be adding quotes if user wants identifiers quoted ? ?
SQu,positive,the following ugly conversion from text to byte is necessary because the byte class is inconsistant when asked to output as hex it does so as an unsigned byte but when asked to read back the same thing using the hex radix it insists that the input must be signed to get around this we up size the conversion to integer then truncate that to a byte and finally convert the byte to a byte yech
SQu,positive,this should just bring back one table i hope
SQu,positive,todo temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido is fix iquerytokenizer qt sessionundertest getquerytokenizer

SQu,positive,hack to deal with firebird is rdb meta tables
SQu,positive,hack to deal with axion axion tables
SQu,positive,handle mouse events for double click creation of popup dialog this happens only in the jtextfield not the jtextarea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the keytexthandler class
SQu,positive,do not use tinyint for now even though mckoi supports it it is notion of tinyint is bit not bit so it is not compatible with other dbs and leads to overflow resulting in negative values which are a corruption of the actual value inserted updated this is not a great work around i filed a bug report on the mailing list hopefully it will get fixed soon
SQu,positive,todo need to define a better approach to getting dialects that is we do not really want to ever prompt the user in this case it is always oracle yet we may have a new oracledialect at some point

SQu,positive,todo col add method to databasemetadata that returns array of objects for getbestrowidentifier for postgresql put this kludge in the new function this way all the kludges are kept in one place kludge for some dbs e g postgresql there is actually a pseudo column providing the rowid but the getbestrowidentifier function is not implemented this kludge hardcodes the knowledge that specific dbs use a specific pseudo column additionally as of pg you must create the table using with oid appended to the create statement otherwise oid column is not available by default
SQu,positive,should probably create my own table model but i am being a bit slack
SQu,positive,this is a work around for what looks like a bug to me it is a syntax error to qualify with the schema the new table name but not the old as in alter table public tablerenametest rename to public tablewasrenamed the second public is apparently not currently a valid thing to do

SQu,positive,jason make menu smarter when second window for the same session is added create a hierarchical menu for all windows for the session
SQu,positive,todo clean this mess up load plugins load all plugin jars into class loader
SQu,positive,for some reason when the oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the tabpnl is first tab ends up being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab this causes the tabs length to be tab greater than the tabs that are actually in the tabpnl this throws off the selection such that the tab selected in the tab panel does not get rendered until the tab to the right of the selected tab is selected this is a work around for this problem until i can determine why the databaseobjectinfotab never makes it into the tabpnl in the first place
SQu,positive,the following is a work around for the problem on mac os x where the apple laf delegates to the swing popup factory but then tries to set a alpha on the underlying cocoa window which will always be null if you  re using jgoodies l f see http www caimito net pebble html comment this has no effect on linux windows
SQu,positive,no appropriate datatype for this column so do the best we can with what we know this may not be the best behavior here
SQu,positive,coldefs not in same order as db so search for matching coldef entry note linear search here will normally be not too bad because most tables do not have huge numbers of columns
SQu,positive,todo what about these viewport font colorchooser font internalframe font optionpane font panel font scrollpane font desktopicon font
SQu,positive,do not use real type axion sets the column size to by default yet it can handle more precision so data being copied from the real column can potentially be larger than what the column claims to support this will be a problem for other databases that pay attention to the column size todo perhaps re introduce the real type but use the new getprecisiondigits to max out the precision
SQu,positive,the following only works if swingutilities getroot table returns and instanceof basemdiparentframe if swingtuilities getroot table returns and instance of dialog or frame then other code must be used
SQu,positive,todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
SQu,positive,this info is merely a placeholder in the tree that we can use to get index name and parent name more easily we probably should create a indexcolumninfo that has this extra info in it
SQu,positive,todo should the constraint name simply be the column name or something more like a constraint name ?
SQu,positive,some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others do not jdbc on some dbmss does not handle pseudo columns  correctly  also gettables returns  views  as well as tables so the thing we are looking at might not be a table jdbc does not give a simple way to determine what we are looking at since the type of object is described in a dbms specific encoding for these reasons rather than testing for all these conditions we just try using the pseudo column info to get the table data and if that fails we try to get the table data without using the pseudo column todo should we change the mode from editable to non editable ?
SQu,positive,todo do we need this one
SQu,positive,set the property values note this may have already been done by another instance of this datatype created to handle a different column
SQu,positive,todo maybe instead of throwing an exception we could ask the user if they would like us to adjust their preference for them
SQu,positive,hack some dbs like frontbase do not support boolean types i  ve tried tinyint bit and boolean as the column type and setboolean fails for all three it is a mystery at this point what column the getboolean setboolean methods actually work on iin frontbase
SQu,positive,work around for this driver which must have dbo for schema the jconnect family of drivers appears to not be affected and can accept a null schema which is necessary to find tables in other schemas within the same catalog similarly jtds does not require this yet it does not return non dbo schema tables unfortunately
SQu,positive,a dialect delegate for the progress database todo progress specification says that the sum of all column lengths of a table row may not exceed need to add an interface method to the hibernatedialect interface that takes an array of lengths and and checks the sum of columns for a row this maximum number may be different across databases so this check method needs to be implemented by each dialect author manningr

SQu,positive,todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean

SQu,positive,? ? split these functions off into a subclass of basefavouriteaction
SQu,positive,arrays of strings are a special case in xmlbeanwriter method processproperty an array of strings is turned into a list of stringwrapper objects in the xml presumably so that when reading them back we have a class that we can call setters on thus when reading back an array of strings we actually read an array of stringwrappers which gives a type mis match in the following arraycopy therefore we need to convert the data that is currently in the stringwrapper objects into actual strings

SQu,positive,todo pass in a message handler so user gets error msgs

SQu,negative,datatypes may limit the initial data read from the db e g to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table to edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing therefore we ask the datatype if we need to re read the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed if there is a problem during the read e g we cannot identify exactly one row in the db matching the current row in the table then the cell is not editable the reverse is not true if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read

SQu,negative,line separator for easy using
SQu,negative,for oracle g we could say something like where xmlserialize content coldef getlabel like   value   this does not appear to work on oracle i at the moment so we will avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non null which is what the superclass implementation does todo find a way to do this for both versions or split this behavior so that it works on g and is disabled on i

SQu,negative,we need this method to satisfy one of the interfaces we implement but since we have moved all operations to the datatype sub panels which initialize their own data during creation there is nothing for us to do here
SQu,negative,we need this in order to allow the user to see this plugin which is not loaded in the plugin summary dialog so that they can enable it
SQu,negative,no tokenizer has been set by any installed plugin go ahead and give the default tokenizer it is important to not cache this object so that session property changes to the current session are reflected in this default tokenizer

SQu,negative,go through each child of the parent and see if it was previously expanded if it was recursively call this method in order to expand the child
SQu,negative,to allow the fw to save and reload user options related to specific columns we construct a unique name for the table so the column can be associcated with only that table some drivers do not provide the catalog or schema info so those parts of the name will end up as null that is ok since this string is never viewed by the user and is just used to distinguish this table from other tables in the db we also include the url used to connect to the db so that the same table db on different machines is treated differently

SQu,negative,default behavior if no appropriate data type found is to create a simple jtextarea with no special handling in theory this cannot happen because if there is no data type object for this column is data type then iseditableinpopup returns false so we should not get here if there is a data type object and iseditableinpopup returns true then we would have executed the return statement above assume that the value can be represented as a string

SQu,negative,clobs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the db is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself during the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read therefore we do not need to re read the datum from the database because we know that we have the entire descriptor if the contents of the clob have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor

SQu,negative,value is a simple string representation of the data but not the same one used in the text and in cell operations the in cell version may replace newline chars with n while this version does not in other respects it is the same as the in cell version because both use the renderer object to do the rendering

SQu,negative,now the popup related methods these are not quite symmetric with the in cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to display in the popup is handled internally to the datatype object inside getjtextarea so we do not need a renderobjectinpopup function visible to the rest of the world

SQu,negative,since we can use a correlated sub query to update all rows in one statement we do not care about the set values unless fromtables is null in which case we go with a normal update using the set values would require an update statement for each row in the merged table for each column that was merged in which is incredibly inefficient however the api is intended to support database dialects that ca not handle correlated sub queries

SQu,negative,tell the rest of the world that the table has changed the  fire  method used here is very course it says that the whole table has been changed when really only one row has been added however finer grained methods did not seem to cause the right effect so i m using this one untill someone reports a problem with it also if either of these notifications the actual model and the sortable model are eliminated it either throws an exception or does not update the gui go figure finally the  fire  on the acutalmodel is triggered from this method rather than from inside the myjtable code because the add method used to add a row is also used when loading the table with lots of rows and in that case we do not want to generate events until all of the rows have been added so the  fire  cannot happen there
